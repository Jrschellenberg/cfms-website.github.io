He is a firm believer of harm reduction and the concept of "health as a human right". Antonio is currently a medical student and a LEAD Scholar at the University of Toronto. After completing the Honours BHSc program at McMaster University, Antonio attended the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for the MSPH degree in the Global Disease Epidemiology &amp; Control program.

Her interest in medicine lies primarily in social medicine and its impact on the health of populations. She spent her early years living both in South Africa and a remote community in northern Alberta. Her early exposure to the impact of poverty and social determinants of health set her on a course to try and change the way some of the most marginalized populations access health. This goal was solidified when she spent six months working with migrant workers in Bangladesh, before starting medical school. On entering her first year of medical school, she noticed a disconnect between the current teachings in social medicine and the reality faced by many patients. She set out to change this. So far in her career, Marguerite has made a significant impact on the way LGBTQ and global health are taught at her university and nationally through the CFMS. Beyond patient care, Marguerite also has an interest in the wellbeing of medical students. She co-led a task force to address mistreatment at her university, resulting in significant policy changes and access to reporting for students. She is currently completing her clerkship in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.</span><span></span></li></ul></div></div><h1><strong>National Officer of Sexual and Reproductive Health (NORSH)</strong></h1><hr /><div id="vp-government-affairs" class="executive"><div class="exec-pic"><img src="/images/officers/2015-2016/jenna-webber.jpg" /></div><div class="exec-info"><ul><li class="exec-name"><span>Jenna Webber</span></li><li class="exec-school"><span>Northern Ontario School of Medicine</span></li><li class="url"><a href="mailto:norsh@cfms.org">norsh@cfms.org</a></li><li class="exec-desc"><span>Hello and bonjour, my name is Jenna (also go by Jay).
