				<p id="letter-intro">Dear colleague,</p>
				<p>Congratulations on your acceptance to medical school! Embarking on medical studies marks the start of an exciting journey towards becoming a physician. Medical education offers the opportunity to join a challenging profession built around excellence and service. With it, there is the opportunity to use your strengths, interests, and curiosity to engage and improve the health of others, and to be involved and bring positive changes to the local, national, and international communities.</p>
				<p>The mission of the Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) is to represent, support, and connect medical students from our fourteen member schools across Canada. Through our branches of representation, communication, and service, we are dedicated to promoting the interests and wellbeing of students studying medicine in Canada. Through our executive members, national officers, and representatives selected from across the country, we advocate for medical student interests at national medical organizations and to the federal government. Some of the organizations to which we send representatives include the Canadian Medical Association (CMA), the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC), the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC), the Canadian Association of Internes and Residents (CAIR), the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS), and the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC). We also organize an annual Lobby Day on Parliament Hill in Ottawa where we meet with MPs and Senators to lobby for issues of relevance to medical students and that promote the health of all Canadians.</p>
				<p>We maintain communication with our members through our bi-annual meetings held in the autumn and the spring, through our school representatives who will be making themselves known to you in the early weeks of your studies, through our bi-monthly communiqué, through regular updates of our website (www.cfms.org), and through our hard copy Annual Review publication. I encourage you to sign-up on our website to ensure you have the most recent news from the CFMS. In order to sign-up on the CFMS website you will require a code, available to you through your school’s CFMS representative. There are many discounts and exclusive offers available through our members-only section, so be sure to sign up!</p>
				<p>Some of the exclusive services we provide to our members include discounts on disability insurance, educational material, and accommodations. Our online databases for clinical elective reviews, residency interview feedback, and housing offerings are some of the services that you may find useful as you progress through your training. Frequently, we also advertise opportunities for funding for projects, various scholarships offered to medical students, and opportunities to attend our meetings. Also available are international opportunities and exchanges through our vibrant Global Health Program which has as one of its mandates to connect with the International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations (IFMSA).</p>
				<p>I am thrilled to welcome you into the CFMS as you begin your medical education! As a new medical student at one of our 14 CFMS-member schools, you are automatically a member of the CFMS. This is your organization and we are here to serve you and to help make your experience in medical school exciting, rewarding, and successful. There are a number of ways to get involved in the CFMS, including attending our bi-annual meetings, joining a committee, applying to be a national officer, or running for one of our executive positions. Be sure to speak to the CFMS representative at your school for more information! In addition to your representative, the CFMS executive members are also available to listen to your ideas and your thoughts and transform them into action. Please feel free to contact me or any other members of the executive at any time - our contact information can be found on the CFMS website.</p>
				<p>On behalf of the entire CFMS executive and all the medical students across Canada, congratulations and enjoy the journey on which you are about to embark.</p>
				<p>Sincerely,</p>
