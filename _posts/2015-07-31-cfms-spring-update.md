The CFMS is hard at work throughout the school year to advocate for medical student interests and to bring our membership high quality services and initiatives.

The Canadian Federation of Medical Students is the organization representing over 8,000 medical students from 14 Canadian medical student societies from coast to coast. We represent medical students to the public, to the federal government, and to national and international medical organizations. This update highlights key activities of the organization from the past year as well as priorities for the year ahead. Should you have any questions for the CFMS, please contact office@cfms.org.
