“I came to medical school from a mental health social work background. What I love about social work is that it aims to understand people in the context of their biological, psychological, social, cultural, and structural intersections. What I love even more about social work - and what I hope to carry into my medical practice - is that it emphasizes the importance of challenging the status quo.

For all current (or future) medical students, I have three pieces of advice: 1) Don’t be afraid to follow a non-linear path. Collect and treasure life experiences.; 2) Find mentors in your professional world whom you can learn from, and lean on; and, 3) Don’t lose your sense of humour. If anyone ever tries to take it away from you...fight them.”
