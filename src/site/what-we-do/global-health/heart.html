			<h1 id="page-title">Health and Environment Adaptive Response Task Force</h1>
			<p>The Health and Environment Adaptive Response Task Force (HEART) was created in 2016, in part to address the CFMS mission of connecting medical students with their societies and other health organizations advancing healthy public policy. The CFMS is in a unique position to facilitate discussion on issues of environment and health, including climate change, both internally and externally. The CFMS can also promote excellence in medical education regarding climate change and health as well as mobilizing the medical student voice on these issues.</p>
			<p>HEART is specifically tasked with, but not limited to, the following responsibilities:</p>
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
				<li>Informing medical students and their educational institutions of the role of health systems in climate change, both as a positive mitigator and a contributor</li>
				<li>In partnership with CFMS general members, the HEART should advocate for public policy, which mitigates environmental health risks in an equitable and evidence-based strategy</li>
				<li>Advises CFMS on organizational best practices to minimize environmental impact</li>
			</ol>
