        <!-- PHYSICAL HEALTH QUICK TIPS -->
        <h2><strong>Mental Health</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a form of physical activity that you enjoy -- it is so much easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle when you aren’t forcing yourself to do things that you don’t love!</li>
            <li>Take small steps to making every day more active -- choose to take the stairs, choose the parking spot that’s further away from the door, use manual tools instead of automatic ones in the kitchen, etc!</li>
            <li>Find a partner that’s interested in similar activities. Exercising with a partner can increase motivation, accountability, and enjoyment!</li>
            <li>Incorporate warm ups at the beginning of every workout and stretching at the end to reduce the risk of injury!</li>
            <li>Getting some fresh air and enjoying the sunlight is definitely good for your health for many reasons, but don’t forget about sun protection too! </li>

            <li>Take advantage of free trials at the gyms or exercise locations around your city. Most places will offer you at least a few days free to get an idea of if you like what they have to offer and if it fits with your goals!</li>
            <li>Encourage your sports/wellness reps to set up a Gym Crawl at your school (like a pub crawl, but you go to local gyms for quick exercise classes instead). It is a great way to explore new exercise options and have some fun with your classmates!</li>
            <li>For all you busy bodies out there, try to incorporate mini workouts during your day. For instance, instead of taking the elevator, start taking the stairs! If you drive or take the shuttle to work, try biking. You will still manage to get a decent workout through those busy days!</li>
            <li>A good diet helps keeps your physical health in shape! Some quick snacking tips for you! Instead of snacking on chips, soda, and junk food. Try some healthier options such as fruits (apples, pears, mangos, kiwi) and vegetables (Celery, carrots, peppers) without dip though!</li>
            <li>People often underestimate how good sleep is for the body! I understand that as med students it’s hard to get a good amount of sleep, especially when you’re on call! Sleep allows your body to rest and recharge. A deficit of sleep not only impacts physical health but mental and emotional health too! Be sure to nap whenever you can and to try and get at least 7 hours of a good night’s rest!</li>
            <li>Being physically healthy includes having a well-rested and sharp mind that’s clean from any negativity! Take 5-10 minutes before you go to sleep to meditate and be mindful! This can decrease anxiety, improve thinking and emotions, and a lot more!</li>

        <!-- MENTAL HEALTH QUICK TIPS --> 
        <h2><strong>Mental Health</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure you get a good quality sleep by minimizing the background noise and light in your bedroom: sleeping mask and ear plugs can be useful (especially on call!).</li>
            <li>Sometimes one negative outcome in the end of a day can diminish all the great things that happened earlier. Try a daily gratitude exercise to enhance to sense of accomplishment and positive emotions!</li>
            <li>Next time you are feeling down, try talking to yourself the way that you would talk to a friend. We are frequently more harsh to ourselves than we are to others. Never forget to show yourself the same kindness you would show other people!</li>
            <li>When you feel overwhelmed, stop and take time for yourself to decompress. Whether that means taking a walk, taking some deep breaths, or venting to a friend. Always have a self-care arsenal ready to go!</li>
            <li>You don’t have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm. Don’t be afraid to say no when you need to. Practice self-care!</li>
            <li>Balancing medical school and personal life might be overwhelming at times. Setting priorities and goals could be a helpful way to relieve the stress and tackle things one at a time.</li>
