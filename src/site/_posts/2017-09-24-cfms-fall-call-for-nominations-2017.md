As the representative voice of Canadian medical students, the Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) represents you and your colleagues to many national medical organizations including the Canadian Medical Association, the College of Family Physicians, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and others.

Each fall and winter, the CFMS selects a new group of talented individuals to help represent medical students to these organizations and offers a chance to general CFMS members to be involved in shaping the future of medicine in Canada. Volunteering for these positions allows students to learn more about medical education, health promotion and more, all while acting as the voice of Canadian medical students.
