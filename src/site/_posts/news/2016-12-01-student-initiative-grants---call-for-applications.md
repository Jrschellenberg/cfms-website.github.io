CFMS Student Initiative Grants (SIG)  were established in response to the increasing number of medical student-led initiatives and the need for official financial support from our national student organization. Many successful projects have benefitted from direct CFMS funding including charitable, educational and social projects all spearheaded by medical students. Our goal is to assist students in realizing  innovative programs that promote interactions between CFMS students in member schools. Maximum funding for projects will be valued at $3000.

Please see the [guidelines](/uploads/SIG Program Guidelines-1.pdf) more information about the grants and how your [application](/uploads/SIG Application Form-1.docx) will be scored. Applications must be submitted to sigs.cfms@gmail.com by **January 18, 2017** to be considered for grant funding. You may email sigs.cfms@gmail.com if you have any further questions or concerns.
