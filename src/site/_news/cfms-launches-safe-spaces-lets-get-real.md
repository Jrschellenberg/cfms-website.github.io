The CFMS is hosting our first [***Safe Spaces: Let's Get Real***](https://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/student-affairs/safe-space.html) learner wellness conversations as part of the National Wellness Program.

***Safe Spaces: Let’s Get Real*** is an opportunity for medical students across the country to discuss a wide range of issues around **medical student health and wellness.**

The two main topics of discussion at our first session will be:

1. **Stresses around residency matching process**
2. **Culture in medical education**

All students are invited to join the facilitated discussion. We hope to help stimulate on-going conversations by connecting members so that we can share ideas and have frank discussion about learner challenges. Further discussion will also aid the CFMS in our advocacy work as part of the National Wellness Program around these issues.

Details: **Sunday April 15th at 5-6PM EST**
