On CFMS National Lobby Day 2017, over 60 students met with MPs and Senators on Parliament Hill to advocate for a federal response to the Opioid Crisis.

The aim of the Opioids Task Force is to synthesize the research and content created by the Research Committee for Lobby Day into a position statement or paper. This would be posted on the CFMS website, and used by the CFMS to further its advocacy efforts and demonstrate continued interest in this area of great concern, to the federal government and other organizations.

The Opioids Task Force will also develop advocacy strategies for increasing the availability of mental health, pain management, and addictions medicine resources, which can help combat this national crisis.
