They came up with this fundraising idea two years ago and approached Planned Parenthood as a potential partner. This year, with the help of a few other medical students, they hope to have another successful year. All funds raised will be donated to the local Planned Parenthood in support of their Pap clinics.</p><p>This fundraiser is intended to draw attention to this women&rsquo;s health issue by engaging the public in a light-hearted challenge involving the growth of leg hair. The concept, explained Ms. Callanan, stems from the MOvember prostate cancer campaign, a successful fundraiser that encourages men to collect donations from sponsors in support of their efforts to grow facial hair during the month of November.</p><p>Participants are encouraged to collect donations from sponsors in support of their leg hair growth.
