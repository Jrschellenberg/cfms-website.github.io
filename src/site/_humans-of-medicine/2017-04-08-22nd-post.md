“I frequently questioned whether or not I should be in medicine. My interests in social justice and public health heavily outweighed those in pathophysiology and clinical medicine. The initiatives and portfolios in the CFMS keep me engaged in advocacy and community engagement projects, and show me that medicine is another means to addressing broad social change with the added bonus of helping a vulnerable person who is sitting across from you. Now I’m confident that patient care is a single piece of the entire health equity puzzle and this is where I need to be.”
