				<p>Each year, medical students across Canada engage in projects that make a difference within their schools and communities. Many of these initiatives are truly incredible &ndash; and can serve as inspiration for the rest of us. They demonstrate the vital role that we play, and what we can (and do) offer to society.</p>
				<p>In order to recognize and publicize these initiatives the Medical Student Spotlight section on the CFMS website was created. Here, we feature some of the ideas that medical students are working on, and how they’re fostering our common goals. We want to make sure that students from across the country know what their colleagues are doing, so that they can be encouraged to do amazing things, too.</p>
