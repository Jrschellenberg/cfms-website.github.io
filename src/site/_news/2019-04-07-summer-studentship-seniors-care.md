###What is a CFMS Summer Studentship?

The Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) is pleased to offer Summer Studentship opportunities to support 1-2 students to continue the work on seniors care and aging. 

A tremendous amount of work and preparation went into the 2019 National Day of Action on seniors care and aging. In an effort to sustain longitudinal advocacy efforts on this important topic, and to enhance capacity building and accountability, the CFMS will be funding medical students to continue this work over the summer of 2019.

###How much funding will be provided?

$4,000 to be paid to each student for a minimum of 8 weeks of research work commitment, with 35-hour weeks. There are two positions available. 

###Project Details

* **TITLE:** An Evidence Informed National Seniorsâ€™ Strategy 
* **Supervisor:** Arianne Persaud, Manger of Advocacy, Stakeholders and Government Relations
Location: National Institute on Ageing, Ryerson University (Toronto) 
* **Dates:** 8 weeks between June-Aug 2019 (dates flexible)

Students will work with Dr. Samir Sinha and the National Institute on Ageing research team to build on the campaign for a National Seniors Strategy. Students will use research and scoping methods including literature reviews, environmental and jurisdictional scans, as well as engaging stakeholders, to translate evidence through a public policy development lens to promote seniors care and healthy aging.
