#### **Lindsay Leigh Kimmett Memorial Foundation**

As medical students, we are extremely fortunate. Every day, we have the opportunity to make new friends, learn new things, and try to live out our dreams. It can be easy to take that for granted. Lindsay Kimmett was a beloved member of the Calgary medical community. Until her tragic passing in 2008, she also worked towards her dreams of a better world, and she made the lives of those around her happier and brighter as she did so.

Though Lindsay is still deeply missed, her legacy has lived on through the efforts of family, friends, and the University of Calgary community that she was such a vibrant part of. To date, the Lindsay Leigh Kimmett Memorial Foundation has raised over $625,000 for local and international initiatives, and is continuing to grow. This year, we’re pairing up with Cochrane’s own marathon man Martin Parnell. Martin’s “Quest For Kids” campaign aims to raise 1 million dollars to help 20,000 children through Right To Play, an international organization that works to improve the lives of children in some of the most disadvantaged areas of the world through the power of sport and play. Our goal is to contribute $100,000 to these efforts, and whatever we raise will be matched three times by our sponsors. Please follow this link to make a donation: http://righttoplay.akaraisin.com/hockeyquest500

This is a great cause.

So, what better way to support international sport and child health than by strapping on your skates and grabbing your hockey stick? It is in this spirit that we carry on with the 5th Annual Kimmett Cup—a 3-on-3 Co-Ed pond hockey tournament, January 19, 2013, at Mitford Pond in Cochrane. Last year was a monumental year with a team from the 2013 class, the Aye-Ayes, taking home the championship trophy in a tournament that was featured on CBC’s Hockey Day in Canada. Following that, Mitford Pond was one of the stops in TSN’s Kraft Celebration Tour.

Believe it or not, this year we’re going to go for something even bigger. The Guinness World Record for number of players in an exhibition hockey game.

We would love it if you could come and take part. Players and spectators are warmly welcomed, and if you want to help in other ways we can use volunteers. If you are interested, donations are also gladly accepted. We can promise a great time playing hockey with friends, and at the end of the day you might even be part of a Guinness World Record. Best of all? Your efforts will help children around the world grow up to have the same opportunities as you and I.
