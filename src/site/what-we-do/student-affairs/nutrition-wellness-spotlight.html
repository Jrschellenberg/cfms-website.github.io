                            <span class="editable">“The traditional way of meal prepping (at least as far as I have been taught) is to set aside one night a week to prepare your meals for the entire upcoming week. I have tried this approach, and usually found it far too daunting, since I would easily spend 3-5 hours trying to make enough food to get me through the week. On top of all the things I have to get done, this quickly seemed like too much of a time investment for me, and I fell back into old habits (eating out, eating ready-made meals, etc.). A simple modification that has worked well for me is to meal prep on two different days every week in order to “cut down” the time I have to invest per day (I know this is purely psychological, but hey, we all have to find ways to trick ourselves). To me, it’s much more manageable to spend 1-2 hours on two separate days than to invest 4-5 hours in one day, especially when I combine the time I spend cooking with other chores. This way, I feel more productive and don’t feel like I’m “wasting” time meal prepping that I could spend doing other things. Sometimes, I also try to time my meal prepping in such a way that it serves either as a study break or my wind-down time in the evening; that way, I feel less guilty about leaving my desk, especially during crunch time.<br><br>I guess I’ll finish with the main thing I used to struggle with, which was thinking that I had to go all in right away. The nice thing about nutrition is that it’s not all-or-nothing, and with most of us being perfectionists, we tend to lose sight of that sometimes (at least I sure did). If you’re someone who seriously struggles with nutrition, try making small changes over time and rocking those small changes guilt-free rather than trying to overhaul your whole life at once.” <br><br>Ricarda Konder<br>Dalhousie University<br>Class of 2020</span>

                            <span class="editable">"As a kid, I always ate what my parents made, which mostly consisted of some kind of meat with potatoes or rice, and a salad. My mother also liked to garden, so we had fresh vegetables occasionally. I feel that much of my nutritional habits stemmed from my parents. Once I moved away for school, I felt that I was able to be more selective in my food choices. My diet now pretty much consists of Canada's Food Guide groups, but not in the exact portions they recommend. I try to eat more to match the energy needs of my physical activity during the day.<br><br>My Kinesiology Co-op degree compliments my positive relationship with food. With the background it provided me in exercise and nutrition, I feel that I am able to eat well and stay well. Once in awhile my nutritional habits slip, and this definitely impacts the way I feel. Generally, I think feeling well is one of the first steps to having a productive day, so I do my best to eat the nutritional foods that I enjoy.<br><br>I would say to anyone struggling with nutrition that having a routine is incredibly important. That way you know how much time you have, so you can plan to do groceries and cook accordingly. I would also say meal prepping is important, because then you have a specific grocery list, so you know what to purchase and are less likely to have impulse buys. Don't feel that you need to pressure yourself to diet because adherence to any diet can be challenging. We as students already have so much pressure and stress in our life. I think it's more important to find healthy foods that you enjoy and incorporate those into your lifestyle!"<br><br>Bradley Rietze<br>Northern Ontario School of Medicine<br>Class of 2021</span>
