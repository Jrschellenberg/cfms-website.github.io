His interest in global health and social medicine stemmed from an undergraduate project on community-based health insurance in Sub-Saharan Africa. At UBC, Golden was the global health liaison (GHLs) for two years, during which time he contributed to the development of a national consensus document on global health competencies for medical students. As the incoming VP Global Health, Golden hopes to strengthen the global health program through strategic planning and capacity-building projects for GHLs.
