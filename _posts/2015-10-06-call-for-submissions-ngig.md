Hello medical students!
 
The National Geriatric Interest Group (NGIG) is assembling our fourth annual publication, and we are currently accepting submissions!
The NGIG is a centralized student-led group started by medical students with the goal of bringing together individual GIGs and creating Canada-wide education initiatives in the field of aging. Each year, we assemble a student run publication that covers a wide range of topics in the field of geriatrics, allowing students an opportunity to learn more about geriatrics and to showcase their work.
 
This year the theme of our publication is "Expanding Horizons: Innovative and Changing Perspectives in Geriatric Care". However, we are accepting submissions on any topic in geriatrics. We are looking for a variety of articles, commentaries, case reports/clinical encounters, creative writing, art, and photography. We are also accepting submissions for cover art. The deadline to submit is **January 10, 2016**. Please see the attached poster for more information. Please email your submissions to <a href="mailto:editor.ngigpublication@gmail.com">editor.ngigpublication@gmail.com</a>.
 
Thank you,
 
NGIG Co-Editors-in-Chief
