                    <h2><strong>An interview with local expert, Dr. Meb Rashid</strong></h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><img src="/uploads/meb-rashid.png"></a></p>
                    <p class="picture-legend">Dr. Meb Rashid is a Toronto-based family physician who specializes in refugee healthcare. He is a co-founding physician of Canadian Doctors for Healthcare, and the current Medical Director of Women's College Hospital's (WCH) Crossroads Clinic for refugees. This clinic provides comprehensive medical services to newly arrived refugee clients for their first two years in Toronto.</p>

                        <span style="font-weight:bold">What are some of the barriers to getting adequate health care as a refugee or claimant?</span>
                        <br>
                        It really depends on the refugee we are considering and how you define adequate healthcare. Many refugees and refugee claimants rely on using walk in clinics for their care.  These serve a purpose but such intermittent care is not ideal for refugee populations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are some refugees who are immensely resourceful and are able to navigate the healthcare system and connect to appropriate care. Others face certain challenges inherent in navigating a complicated medical system. How can you find a doctor when in many areas there exists a shortage of healthcare providers and many have full practices? There are also more practical issues such as language discordance - those who don’t speak English or French - and lack of interpretation services. Access to interpreters is quite varied in the healthcare setting. Additionally, health insurance is a huge issue. Many refugees rely on the Interim Federal Health Plan, which is filled with nuances and not well known by physicians. It adds an extra layer of complexity when physicians are not familiar with what is covered for their patients. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One other issue which is often a struggle for us, is the lack of emphasis on primary care.  Many refugees, particularly early in their migration process, have a number of competing priorities.  They need to navigate housing, school for their children, how to navigate public transit etc..  It’s easy to de-emphasize health care particularly if one does not have any pronounced symptoms.  Additionally, many people originate in parts of the world where one only visits a health care provider when they are sick.  The idea of prevention is not always fundamental to people’s conception of health care.  For all these reasons, connecting people to a primary care provider early in their migration trajectory can be a challenge.
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">You spoke about defining “adequate healthcare” for this population. What does that look like for you?</span>
                        <br>
                        For us at the Crossroads Clinic, adequate healthcare means connecting our patients to primary care early in their migration trajectory. This is important for all refugees for several reasons. First, there is a tremendous amount of subclinical disease in refugee populations, including a significant prevalence of  health care conditions such as hepatitis B but also chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes.  Often these conditions are undiagnosed and thus there is a tremendous benefit to connecting people to primary care to allow for ensure that such conditions are recognized and addressed before complications arise.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        More than anything, however, adequate healthcare is about developing a relationship with your patient and providing the support that people require. All refugees face unique challenges and may require different forms of medical assistance or connection to resources. Ensuring the creation of a safe and trusting environment where refugees can share their challenges and concerns is critical to providing care for refugee populations.
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">What are some of the immediate SDOH that refugees face as they navigate a new environment?</span>
                        <br>
                        For most refugees, the social determinants play an immense role in their health.   In particular, language acquisition is a tremendous challenge, but this obviously depends on the age they migrate. Children acquire language skills very quickly but this may create an imbalance of power in families where they end up being the source for accessing Canadian society for entire family.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Other challenges include finding housing and employment.   Housing is increasingly inaccessible across the country.  It can be difficult finding work in a profession that honors the skills that a newcomer had cultivated in their country of origin. For all these years, most refugees live in poverty for their first few years in Canada. 
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">What are some of the long term health consequences of these barriers?</span>
                        <br>
                        In Canada, there is still a paucity of literature that describes the health care trajectory of refugee populations.   Although all refugees are fleeing persecution, they are immensely different. Some are highly educated urbanites; others may have had limited education access to education. Health outcomes and daily challenges vary. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There is some data showing that most refugees do very well over time.  This is likely due to a selection bias: those that have managed to make it to Canada have often been able to overcome immense obstacles.  They are the survivors and most have endured journeys that would have been very difficult for the frail and those that struggle with significant health issues.  Refugees develop a tremendous resiliency and this serves them well over time in Canada.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our experience at the Crossroads Clinic has demonstrated two factors that impact the long term health of refugee populations.  First, where subclinical conditions are recognized and addressed, there is an opportunity to manage conditions before they cause significant health outcomes with the resulting challenges on successful settlement.  The second is directly dependent on the social determinant of health.  People tend to do better when they can find good jobs, when they are united with family, when they find housing in neighborhoods where they can thrive.  Where these opportunities are available, refugees do very well.
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight:bold">What is the number one thing as a medical student that we should be aware of when dealing with this population?</span>
                        <br>
                        The most important thing for us to consider in working with refugee populations is how to  acquire people's trust. As medical professionals - students and physicians - we must ensure that we are sensitive to their unique struggles.   Remember that for some, they may be detached and even reticent about connecting to care.  This may be due to previous trauma including exposure to war or torture and sometimes even torture in a setting where health care workers were present.  Thinking about ways to cultivate the relationship is a challenge but approaching patients with humility and kindness goes a long way to beginning that relationship.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another thing for health care workers to consider is the importance of trying to support newcomers with the social determinants of health.  Whether it is writing support letters or advocating for issues around housing, this not only aids refugees in addressing their issues, it also helps to develop the relationship and acquires the trust of our patients.

To begin, access to health insurance to cover health services is dependent on one’s immigration status. Canadian citizens and permanent residents are entitled to provincial health care. Refugee claimants, including failed refugee claimants, are entitled to Interim Federal Health, which provides them with access to basic health care services but is not as broad as provincial health insurance programs. People who have temporary status in Canada (visitors, students, workers with short term work permits) are not entitled to provincial health insurance and are expected to pay for their health care needs. Likewise, people without any status in Canada are not entitled to health government funded insurance coverage. Lack of and/or limited health insurance means that refugees and migrants will often access health services only when their health is in crisis.<br>A person’s lack of immigration status can also impact on their physical and mental health other ways. The length of time it can take to regularize one’s immigration status in Canada can take a toll on a person’s health as they worry and wait to obtain status. Unfortunately, the resulting deterioration of a refugee claimant’s physical and mental health can also affect their ability to obtain status. For example, refugee claimants whose mental health deteriorates as they wait for their hearing before the Immigration and Refugee Board may have a harder time testifying in the hearing room. This can have a negative impact on their credibility and potentially affect the outcome of their refugee claim.<br>Finally, separation from loved ones can also have an impact on a person’s mental and physical health. I have many clients who were determined to be Convention refugees in Canada and who, when they applied for permanent residence, included their dependence overseas. Because their loved ones are often in a precarious situation back home, the worry and anxiety my clients have while they wait to be reunited with their family members can have an impact on their physical and mental well-being.” <br><br><i>Laila Demirdache, Immigration and Refugee Lawyer</i></span></li>
