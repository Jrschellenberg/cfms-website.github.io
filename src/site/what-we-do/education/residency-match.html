			<p>Every year, all Canadian medical graduates who wish to pursue post-graduate medical education in Canada apply for offered residency positions through the match process. The Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMS) administers the match each year through their online application service. For more information on the match process and timeline, please refer to the <a href="https://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/education/cfms-matchbook.html">CFMS Match Book</a> and visit the <a href="https://www.carms.ca/en/">CaRMS website</a>.</p>
			<h1><strong>For Students Unmatched After the Second Iteration of the R-1 Match</strong></h1>
			<p>Results of the second iteration of the match (R-1) are made available at noon EST on April 11th, 2018. If you did not match after the second iteration,&nbsp; please consider the following next steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Join the <em><strong>CFMS Unmatched Student Network</strong>&nbsp;</em>if you would like to be connected with a peer mentor who previously went unmatched. Email&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(118,112,101,100,117,99,97,116,105,111,110,64,99,102,109,115,46,111,114,103))">vpeducation@cfms.org</a>&nbsp;<em>confidentially</em> to join.</li>
				<li>Learn about the new <em><strong>Canadian Armed Forces Medical Officer Training Program for Unmatched Students - Surge 2018</strong></em>, launched April 11, 2018. There are&nbsp;<strong>opportunities to start residency in Family Medicine in July 2018</strong>. There will be a&nbsp;<strong>Q&amp;A on April 11, from 8-9:30 pm ET</strong>. More information available <a href="https://www.cfms.org/news/2018/04/11/canadian-armed-forces-medical-officer-training-program-for-unmatched-students.html">here</a>.</li>
				<li>Please email vpeducation@cfms.org&nbsp;<em>confidentially</em>, to <strong>receive updated information</strong>&nbsp;for unmatched students going forward.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are working with previously unmatched students to support them in their journey and to develop strategies to support unmatched students. Advocating for more residency positions - a ratio of 1:1.2 students-to-residency spots - is a top priority for the CFMS. Every Canadian medical student deserves a fair and reasonable chance of obtaining a residency position. There are simply not enough residency spots for the number of graduating students of Canadian medical schools, and unmatched students from previous years.</p>
			<p>We have been working with faculties, funders, governments, politicians and the military to increase the number of residency spots available and are speaking about the need for progress on this crucial issue in the media on a weekly basis.</p>
			<p>If you are an unmatched student, you are not alone. We are here for you and will do whatever we can to support you in your journey.</p>
			<p>The CFMS is here to support you. Please feel free to get in touch at any time by emailing&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(118,112,101,100,117,99,97,116,105,111,110,64,99,102,109,115,46,111,114,103))">vpeducation@cfms.org</a>&nbsp;<em>confidentially</em>.&nbsp;</p>
