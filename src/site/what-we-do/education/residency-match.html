			<h1 id="page-title">Residency Match</h1>
			<p class="present-before-paste">Every year, all Canadian medical graduates who wish to pursue post-graduate medical education in Canada apply for offered residency positions through the match process. The Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMS) administers the match each year through their online application service. For more information on the match process and timeline, please refer to the <a href="https://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/education/cfms-matchbook.html">CFMS Match Book</a> and visit the <a href="https://www.carms.ca/en/">CaRMS website</a>.</p>
			<h1><strong>For Students Unmatched After R-1</strong></h1>
			<p class="present-before-paste">Results of the first iteration of the match (R-1) are typically made available at noon EST on Match Day, on March 1st. Not all Canadian medical graduates match in the first iteration. If you did not match in the first iteration, please get in touch with your student affairs office as soon as possible and visit the <a href="https://www.carms.ca/en/">CaRMS website</a> for information on applying for the second iteration of the match.</p>
