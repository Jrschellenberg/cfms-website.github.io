                        <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Congratulations on your acceptance to medical school!
                            Embarking on medical studies marks the start of an exciting journey towards becoming a physician. Medical education
                            offers the opportunity to join a challenging profession built around excellence and service. With it, there is the
                            opportunity to use your strengths, interests, and curiosity to engage and improve the health of others, and to be
                            involved and bring positive changes to the local, national, and international communities.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The mission of the Canadian Federation of Medical
                            Students (CFMS) is to connect, support, and represent our membership from 15 Canadian medical student societies as
                            they learn to serve patients and society. Through our branches of representation, communication, and service, we are
                            dedicated to promoting the interests and wellbeing of students studying medicine in Canada. Through our board
                            members, national officers, and representatives selected from across the country, we advocate for medical student
                            interests at national medical organizations and to the federal government. Some of the organizations to which we
                            send representatives include the Canadian Medical Association (CMA), the College of Family Physicians of Canada
                            (CFPC), the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC), the Resident Doctors of Canada (RDoC), the
                            Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS), and the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC). We also
                            organize an annual Day of Action on Parliament Hill in Ottawa where we meet with MPs and Senators to lobby for
                            issues of relevance to medical students and that promote the health of all Canadians.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have been working very hard at updating our website (<span
                                class="s1">www.cfms.org</span>). I encourage you to sign-up on our website to ensure you have the most recent
                            news from the CFMS and access discounts and exclusive offers available through our members-only section. In order to
                            access the members-only section on the CFMS website you will require a code. Please contact your local CFMS representative for the sign-up code.
                            The code will become active on July 4. We maintain communication with our members through our bi-annual
                            meetings held in the Fall and the Spring, through our school representatives who will be making themselves known to
                            you in the early weeks of your studies, through our bi-monthly Communiqué, and through our hard copy Annual Review
                            publication.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The CFMS has a collaborative partnership with MD
                            Financial Management (MD). MD’s sole focus is to help Canadian physicians and their families achieve greater
                            financial security and peace of mind. That focused commitment starts with supporting medical students and helping
                            ensure they succeed as they begin their careers, whether it is providing advice on debt management, paying for
                            medical school or preparing for residency and practice. Medical students can benefit from MD&#39;s specialized
                            network of advisors who are dedicated to addressing the financial needs and goals of medical students, including
                            advice about how to finance medical education while minimizing debt.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of the exclusive services we provide to our members
                            include discounts on educational materials, flights and accommodations. Our online databases for residency interview
                            feedback, is</p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">one of the services that you may find useful as you
                            progress through your training. Frequently, we also advertise opportunities for funding for projects, various
                            scholarships offered to medical students, and opportunities to attend our meetings. Also available are international
                            opportunities and exchanges through our vibrant Global Health Program which has as one of its mandates to connect
                            with the International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations (IFMSA).</p>
