This year’s cover art theme is ‘Indigenous Health’! We are looking for cover art submissions designed by medical students. Feel free to use your artistic license to put together a design based on what Indigenous Health means to you. The specifications are 8.5 by 11 inches. One design will be chosen for this year’s cover art, but the remaining submissions may be featured in the creative art section of the magazine.

The magazine is circulated to readers across Canada, including medical students, medical school deans, medical organizations, provincial ministers of health, and members of parliament.

Please submit written articles of up to 800 words (reflection, opinion/editorial), as well as creative works (short stories, poems, artwork, photography). Photos from travels, electives abroad, newborns, and weddings are encouraged!
