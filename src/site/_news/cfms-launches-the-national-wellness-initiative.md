The CFMS is excited to launch the National Wellness Initiative (NWI), a three-fold component of our efforts to improve medical student wellbeing! The NWI includes:

1) **The CFMS Wellness Challenge:** Running from Jan. 22-Feb. 18, the theme of this year’s Wellness Challenge is “Small Steps: Accessible Wellness”. With challenge options that are do-able for even the busiest clerk, it’s a great way to start off the year on a healthy note and have a chance to win some great prizes. More information (including registration link) found here: [https://www.cfms.org/news/2018/01/22/cfms-wellness-challenge-2018-small-steps-accessible-wellness.html](https://www.cfms.org/news/2018/01/22/cfms-wellness-challenge-2018-small-steps-accessible-wellness.html)

**2) The Longitudinal Wellness Initiative (LWI):**This year, as part of our new wellness strategy, we will be launching the Longitudinal Wellness Initiative (LWI), where we will be further developing each of our Wellness Challenge weekly themes in two-month intervals from March-Dec. 2018. In preparation, we are still seeking committee members to help develop this new project. If you are interested in contributing, please contact Iuliia Povieriena at [ipovi049@uottawa.ca](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(105,112,111,118,105,48,52,57,64,117,111,116,116,97,119,97,46,99,97))). More information about the LWI committee responsibilities can be found here: [http://bit.ly/2CSaKwJ](http://bit.ly/2CSaKwJ).

3) **Wellness Spotlight Profiles:**In parallel with the LWI, CFMS will be adding regular profiles of member medical students and how they are managing and traveling along their own wellness journeys during medical school in the areas of Nutrition, Mental Wellness, Physical Wellness, and Relationships/Social Wellness. If you would like to be featured or would like to nominate a medical school colleague, please email Michelle Moody at [mam524@mun.ca](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(109,97,109,53,50,52,64,109,117,110,46,99,97))).
