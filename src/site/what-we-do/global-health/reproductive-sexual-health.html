        <p><strong><span
                style="text-decoration: underline;">National Officer of Reproductive and Sexual Health Role</span></strong>
        </p>
        <p>We recognize the impact of discrimination based on gender and sexuality on patient’s health.&nbsp; We also
            recognize the importance of advocacy and information when it comes to improving sexual health.&nbsp; It is
            based on these principles that the National Officer of Reproductive and Sexual Health (NORSH) and the Local
            Officers of Reproductive and Sexual Health (LORSHs) work upon.</p>
        <p>The NORSH is responsible for leading projects and initiatives in the area of reproductive and sexual health,
            and liaising with external global-health related organizations in order to benefit and create opportunities
            for Canadian medical students at large.&nbsp; The NORSH works in collaboration with the rest of the Global
            Health Program, including the National Officers, the Global Health Liaisons, and the LORSHs.</p>
        <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific 2012/2013 NORSH Initiatives</span></strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>1.Distribute a survey to Canadian medical schools to assess the extent to which reproductive and sexual
                health topics are covered within the curriculum.
            </li>
            <li>2.Use the survey results to develop innovative and useful ways to target gaps and discrepancies and
                improve the reproductive and sexual health knowledge of medical students.
            </li>
            <li>3.With two upcoming provincial elections (Nova Scotia and British Columbia) and a national Liberal Party
                leadership race coming in 2013, the NORSH and LORSHs will be involved in determining where candidates
                stand on specific issues (ex. LGBTQ health, reproductive rights etc.).&nbsp; The results could then be
                published in newspapers, newsletters and disseminated to medical students.
            </li>
            <li>4.We will also be working to lobby both provincial and federal governments on specific issues.</li>
            <li>5.Improve relations with other national and international organizations in order to develop more areas
                of partnership and collaboration.
            </li>
