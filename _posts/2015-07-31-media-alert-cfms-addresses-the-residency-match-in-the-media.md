MEDIA ALERT &ndash; June 5th, 2015

Recent media reports have drawn attention to the integrity of candidates participating in the residency matching process in Canada.  The Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) supports its student members in upholding the highest standards of professionalism.  To further themselves as medical professionals, medical students must ensure that their behaviour, at all times, justifies the trust that the patient and the public place in medical practitioners and the medical profession.  In accordance with the CFMS Guide to Medical Professionalism, the CFMS expects that all medical students will be honest, trustworthy and punctual when recording clinical activities and procedures and in their CVs and applications, including residency applications.

We recognize the increasingly competitive nature of the residency matching process. It is important to ensure Canadian medical graduates are able to apply their training to serve the Canadian population. Thorough career counselling and detailed predictions on the type and number of physicians needed in the future will help medical students to make evidence-based career decisions that meet society&#39;s health needs.

The Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) is the organization representing over 8,000 medical students from 14 medical student societies from coast to coast.
