In partnership with MD Financial Management, the CFMS provides financial assistance for CFMS member medical students who wish to attend our Annual General Meeting, held this September 18th-20th, 2015 in Windsor, Ontario.

This initiative supports non-elected members to attend CFMS meetings with the goals of fostering greater member awareness of CFMS structure and function, promoting increased interest in the CFMS and facilitating increased participation in CFMS activities. The application process is competitive and the CFMS routinely receives a far greater number of applications than the number of funded spots available. Applicants are selected based solely on the merits of their written application as judged by a selection committee.

Applications for this year will be released next week and are due by August 7th 2015 and should be emailed to Carl White Ulysse, Quebec Regional Representative and Executive VP, at [quebec@cfms.org](mailto:quebec@cfms.org).

Please download the 2015 application form below.

**If you are applying for Travel Funding, please do not register for AGM until after the decisions have been released (August 12th)**
