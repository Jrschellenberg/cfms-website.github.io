			<p>In 2009, the Lancet journal named Climate Change as the biggest global-health of the 21st century. In 2017, the same is arguably still true. The CFMS Global Advocates are excited to raise awareness about the health effects of climate change. Below you will find the work the advocates are doing on this topic. Feel free to contact Henry Annan, National Officer of Human Rights and Peace at <a href="mailto:norp@cfms.org">norp@cfms.org</a>.
