#### **Feb-U-Hairy - Memorial University**

Two medical students have come up with a unique way of raising awareness and funds for cervical cancer and the importance of screening.  
Kathleen Callanan and Angelique Myles, both medical students at Memorial University are dubbing February as "Feb-U-Hairy" and challenging women and men to grow leg hair from Feb. 1 - Feb. 29.

This will be the third year for the campaign. They came up with this fundraising idea two years ago and approached Planned Parenthood as a potential partner. This year, with the help of a few other medical students, they hope to have another successful year. All funds raised will be donated to the local Planned Parenthood in support of their Pap clinics.

This fundraiser is intended to draw attention to this women’s health issue by engaging the public in a light-hearted challenge involving the growth of leg hair. The concept, explained Ms. Callanan, stems from the MOvember prostate cancer campaign, a successful fundraiser that encourages men to collect donations from sponsors in support of their efforts to grow facial hair during the month of November.

Participants are encouraged to collect donations from sponsors in support of their leg hair growth.
