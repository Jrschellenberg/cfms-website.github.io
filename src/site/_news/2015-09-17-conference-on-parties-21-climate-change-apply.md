> #### **Important**
> In collaboration with the International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA), the Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) is proud to offer the following opportunity. Please note that you will need to have your application package signed off by the *Vice President Global Health*, prior to submission (please email [globalhealth@cfms.org](mailto:globalhealth@cfms.org) ASAP).

This is to announce that we are looking for delegates to the COP 21 - the awaited Paris Climate change conference which will happen on November 30th - December 11th in Paris, France. The delegation will be composed of six (6) persons, including an IFMSA Official who will coordinate the delegation. This meeting will be overviewed by the IFMSA Liaison Officer for Public Health Issues 2015-2016.

## **What is COP?**

Every year, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) hosts its annual conference, known as the 'COP'. This conference brings tens of thousands of key stake holders together from member states, Civil Society Groups and Inter Governmental Agencies from all over the world to talk about international collaboration on Climate Change. It will be an event that will be influencing global and national policy on adaptation and mitigation efforts.

All the eyes are on Paris. COP21 will be the event defining how the world will tackle climate change in the 21st century. It is expected that COP21 will serve as a platform where countries will adopt a legally binding and universal international climate agreement. This would be a first in over 20 years of climate talks!
