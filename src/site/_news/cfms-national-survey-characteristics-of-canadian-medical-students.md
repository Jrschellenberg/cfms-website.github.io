There is a research project underway led by a team of medical students, Jeffrey Gustafson, Rishad Khan, and Tavis Apramian, under the supervision of Dr. Shannon Sibbald. This study involves a survey to understand the demographics and past experiences of Canadian medical students. The CFMS has carried out surveys of this nature in 2002 and 2009, with results helping to shape admissions policies and medical education.

&nbsp;

Medical students have been sent an email containing more information and the survey links. You will also be sent two reminder emails in two and four weeks respectively.

&nbsp;

If you have any questions or require additional information regarding this study, please telephone Dr. Shannon Sibbald at (519) 661-2111 ext. 86258 or email [ssibbald@uwo.ca](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(115,115,105,98,98,97,108,100,64,117,119,111,46,99,97)))
