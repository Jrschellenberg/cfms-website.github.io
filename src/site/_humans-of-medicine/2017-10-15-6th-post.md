"When I painting I’m allowed to go outside the lines. It’s okay if I mess up, or make something hideous because as long as I have the proper supplies I get infinite do-overs. Everyone needs something that gives them the freedom to learn from their mistakes.” 

- Medical Student, University of Toronto
