Dear students,

The University of Toronto Medical Journal (UTMJ), Canada's oldest student-run scientific publication, is looking for submissions for our upcoming issue on Paediatric Medicine.

We publish several themed issues yearly and serve as a place for students, residents and faculty to publish their primary work, reviews and commentaries.

The deadline for submission is October 1, 2016 for our print issue. However, we do accept articles on a rolling-basis beyond this deadline and submissions are not restricted to theme-related topics in order to be published.

A description of the theme, details for submission and relevant deadlines can be found in the attached PDF file.

Please let us know if you have any questions at: [editors.utmj@utoronto.ca](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(101,100,105,116,111,114,115,46,117,116,109,106,64,117,116,111,114,111,110,116,111,46,99,97))).
