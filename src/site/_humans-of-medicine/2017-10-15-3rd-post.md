"I started watching Grey’s Anatomy when I was twelve years old (my parents probably shouldn’t have let me). I always thought that if I ever needed cardiac surgery, I would want my surgeon to be like Dr. Yang. She is fierce, smart, doesn’t need a man to be happy and successful, and is a loyal friend. She is a really great role model as far as TV characters go for young women. She broke down gender barriers and stereotypes, and is remembered for her intelligence, her skill in medicine, and her intensity, not her beauty or who she married. My favourite Christina Yang line is: “Oh screw beautiful. I’m brilliant. If you want to appease me, compliment my brain.” I may have borrowed this line a few times in my life…"
