It is with great excitement that the CFMS is announcing a new partnership with the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. The Canadian Medical Hall of Fame (CMHF) is a national registered charity located in London, Ontario that recognizes and celebrates Canadian heroes, whose work has advanced health in Canada and around the world. The CMHF inspires the pursuit of careers in the health sciences through national outreach programs and the promotion of the stories of their Laureates.

The CFMS has worked with members of the CMHF to secure membership of a Canadian Medical Student on the CMHF Board of Directors. This is an exciting new position, that will be filled by a candidate interested in Canada’s rich medical history, one who is passionate about excellence in leadership in health and who is eager to bring the voice of Canada’s emerging health leaders to a strong board of tenured professionals from across the country!

The CFMS is delighted to be a part of this new relationship with the CMHF. If you are interested in becoming the CFMS Representative to the CMHF, stay tuned for information coming in April on how to apply!
