In accordance to the resolution passed at SGM 2018, “[Motion to establish a task force to review criminal justice reform with regards to marginalization and stigmatization of persons who use substances](https://www.cfms.org/files/meetings/sgm-2018/resolutions/resolution-13.pdf)”, the CFMS Committee of Health Policy and CFMS Advocacy Portfolio opens a call for applications for involvement in the task force that will address this specific topic.

This resolution was created to form a CFMS task force, consisting of CFMS members-at-large, officers, and/or executive members, to work on a position paper in favor of criminal justice reform in order not to further marginalize and stigmatize persons who use opioids, cannabis, and other controlled substances; including, but not limited to, amnesty for people who have been penalized under the current legislation because of non-violent crimes.

It is well understood that incarceration and having a criminal record are detrimental social determinants of health. Further, organizations in Canada and abroad (Global Commission on Drug Policy, the World Health Organization and both the Canadian and American Public Health Associations), support the decriminalization of possessing small quantities of currently illegal psychoactive substances.

If interested, please apply by **May 31st at 5 PM (EST), 2018**.

Questions may be directed to the CFMS National Officer of Health Policy, Syeda Shanza Hashmi, at [nohp@cfms.org](mailto:nohp@cfms.org) or CFMS Vice President Government Affairs, Yipeng Ge, at [vpgovtaffairs@cfms.org](mailto:vpgovtaffairs@cfms.org)
