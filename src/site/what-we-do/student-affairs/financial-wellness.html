			<p>Medical school is challenging from a financial perspective given the high cost of tuition, living, electives etc. A secure financial situation is very important for wellness during medical training and that’s why our focus for July and August is on financial wellness.</p>
			<p>Here are some things you can do to help with your financial health throughout medical school.</p>
			<p><strong>Meet with a financial advisor and have a financial plan</strong></p>
			<p>While there is great variation in the financial situation students are in entering medical school, many students don’t have much in the way of financial wealth as we enter our training programs. Meeting with a financial advisor is still very important as they can help you with overall longer-term financial planning even if you don’t have a lot of assets to your name just yet.</p>
			<p>Having a strong financial plan that meets your needs, while having the goal of minimizing your debt when you graduate is to everyone’s advantage.</p>
			<p>Financial plans are also important in helping you determine what types of and how much financial assistance to apply for. Scholarships and bursaries applications are important source of funding to apply to. Hopefully, your student affairs offices will have lots of information on those for you to utilize!</p>
			<p>Government student loans (both provincial and federal) are another source to tap into. Check with your provinces secondary education departments for local details!</p>
			<p>There are many options for medical student lines of credit as well. Speaking with a financial advisor and considering your financial goals are very important in deciding whether or not to obtain a line of credit and further which option (because there are many) to choose.</p>
			<p><strong>Be in the driver seat with you financial health:</strong></p>
			<p>Establish a monthly budget that takes into consideration all of your core living expenses as well as the additional fees that come with medical training. Having a budget laid out often surprises us as we realize opportunities for savings and/or re-allocation. It takes time, yes, but budgeting is an important habit to get into, both for now and in the future as you practice.</p>
			<p><strong>Protect your biggest asset!, yourself! Have the proper insurance:</strong></p>
			<p>Having the proper life, disability and other insurance policies are essential. Your future earning potential as a resident and practicing physician is an important asset.</p>
			<p>Disability insurance is often offered to students for free or at highly discounted rates depending on your local PTMA and other offerings. While it may seem that you will “never need it” and “it’s just another set of forms to fill out”, the medical profession is a challenging one and not uncommonly work-related incidents result in practitioner disability that affects their medical practice. The type of insurance plan that is best for you varies depending on your unique circumstances but learning about the options and getting a policy early could be one of the better decisions you make.</p>
			<p><strong>Tap Into the available Support Resources</strong></p>
			<p>Your school’s student affairs office often has an abundance of resources to help students find the right supports and expertise regarding their financial health. As mentioned earlier, meeting with a financial advisor who knows and understands professional students and their unique situation is important in helping close any knowledge gaps you may have. For the financial wellness months the CFMS will have some videos and other resources to help support you, further we are advocating and working with stakeholders on strong financial literacy curricula to be available to all undergraduate medical trainees.</p>
			<p>We are looking for additional resources, if you’ve come across resources that you think would be great for other students please let us know!</p>
