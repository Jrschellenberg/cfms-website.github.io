“I saw a loved one try to navigate the complexities around access to care, medications and ongoing support and realized just how many gaps exist where the most vulnerable people can fall right through. Our system is imperfect, but I do have so much hope for it and through working with the CFMS I intend to learn more about the role that I can play in making it better.”
