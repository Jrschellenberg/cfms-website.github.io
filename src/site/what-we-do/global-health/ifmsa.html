Symposium webcast: Fulfill Young People&rsquo;s Sexual Rights</strong></p><p>Participate in this livestream hosted by The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and the World Association for Sexual Health (WAS) in partnership with the Columbia Population Research Center (CPRC). &nbsp;</p><p>About:<br />Translating the sexual rights of young people into practice not only involves raising awareness among young people for them to claim their rights, but working with duty bearers, such as health providers, educators and policy makers for them to fulfill these rights in law and in services. As adolescence is a time of gradually gaining responsibilities, implementing the rights of adolescents specifically involves a dynamic process of striking a balance between protecting them while respecting their autonomy and promoting their empowerment. With this in mind, IPPF and WAS developed Fulfil! A Guidance Document for the Implementation of Young People&rsquo;s Sexual Right (2016). Join us in this exciting Symposium with experts on adolescent&rsquo;s health and sexual and reproductive health and rights.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cupop.formstack.com/forms/fulfill">https://cupop.formstack.com/forms/fulfill</a></p><p>Date and time: Friday April 21st 2017 from 4:00-5:30 pm</p><p>Link: email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cprc@columbia.edu">cprc@columbia.edu</a>&nbsp;for livestream link</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4.
