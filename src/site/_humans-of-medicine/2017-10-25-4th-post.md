"My greatest inspiration is my grandmother, who died suddenly about a year ago. She was compassion and altruism personified. She was always willing to help out family, friends and strangers alike in their time of need regardless of how little money she had or how busy she was. She was also my biggest cheerleader and greatest teacher—teaching me about the importance of being principled, respecting the viewpoints of others and never being too proud to say please, thank you and sorry. I remember the day I was elected CFMS president, April 29, 2017. That was the same day she would have celebrated her 84th birthday—the first birthday I had missed. It was an emotional day to say the least."


- Henry Annan, CFMS President (Dalhousie University)
