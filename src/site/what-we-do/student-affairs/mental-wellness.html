                <i>Our Stories -</i> An evening dedicated to having a judgment free open-mic night where we invite students to come and listen to the stories of their peers or tell their own! We aim to de-stigmatize mental illness and get uOttawa medical students talking about their experiences. The event is closed to the public and only medical students are allowed to attend to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Students can choose to submit their stories in advance to read themselves at the event or submit anonymous stories that can be read by their peers. We hold a pre-reading for our speakers the evening before at our wellness committee co-chair’s house to ensure that all speakers have had a chance to run through their story and share it with others prior to presenting in front of a large audience. We hold this event off campus to help create a more private atmosphere and avoid direct affiliation with the faculty to help students feel more open about sharing. On the night of the event, at intermission, we allow students to sign up to share on the day of. This is very well attended event and has really helped to create a more welcoming environment at uOttawa.

                <i>De-stressing Room -</i> Prior to the first year’s first exam in the fall, the Student Wellness Committee hosted a “De-stressing Room” held in one of our small group session rooms. We had healthy snacks, games, colouring books and decorations to create a more welcoming environment. We also had members of our Peer Tutoring team and wellness committee sit in the room so that students could come to talk to upper years in hopes of allowing them to escape the often stressful studying stress bubble of their own class in the library. The aim of this room was to encourage students to remember to take a break and look after themselves while studying. We also had a brainstorming wall on the whiteboard of “What makes you well?” where students could come in and write/draw things on the board that help them to destress while in the exam season. 
            </p>

            <p><i>Wide Open -</i> This a new event this year that the Student Wellness Committee has organized this year. The event is focussed on creating small group sessions to promote discussions about mental health and coping strategies throughout medical school. Following Our Stories, we wanted to continue the discussion about mental health and some of the struggles that all of us experience to help break the stigma of mental health wide open.</p>

            <p><i>Mindfulness -</i> As part of our curriculum throughout medical school, our faculty provides us with mandatory mindfulness sessions where we learn some of the basic skills of mindfulness. They also provide weekly mindfulness drop in sessions every week. </p>

This short mindfulness practice occurs for 20 minutes before classes on Thursday morning. As part of CFMS Wellness Month, our wellness consultant also offers an hour-long presentation on the benefits of mindfulness and how to incorporate it into the lives of busy medical students.</p>

            <p><i>Mental Health Pop-Ups -</i> The wellness committee and psychiatry interest group have come together to set up a small coloring station with coffee, tea and treats. This allows students to drop by and take a mental health break from their busy school day.</p>

MIND also organises the annual Laura Taylor award, which recognises students who’ve helped foster an open and supportive community within our school.

                <i>The Open Mic: </i>The open mic is a new event this year in which music, poetry, spoken word and any form of expression are welcomed. It aims to provide a platform for students to express their journey through medical school. The first part of the night is reserved for planned performances and  one can have the possibility of submitting a text for another student to read if one wishes to stay anonymous. In the second part of the night, any member of the audience may take the stage. 
                This helps some students relieve their stress and express themselves regarding any issues or anxiety in medical school. It also allows the formation of a small community of students helping each other cope.

            <p><i>Mental Health Advocates </i>student group ran a number of events focusing on a broad range of topics related to mental health:<br><br>Their biggest event was hosting <i>Mental Health Awareness Week</i> for the medical students with events each day. This included a Suicide Cases workshop, where participants learned about taking a suicide history and interventions guided by facilitators; a lunch talk on Burnout Syndrome; an interprofessional panel with physicians and a nurse discussing an approach to mental health cases in acute care; a lunch talk on anxiety; and was capped off with Mental Health Monologues. This former event was hosted on campus in a closed venue, providing a forum for students to share their experiences with mental health challenges and successes.<br><br>Additionally, they hosted a <i>Wine and Cheese Night</i> to showcase medical students' submissions of art reflecting mental health. Students had opportunity to participate in a paint night, hosted by the Arts and Humanities in Medicine group, or create art of any medium for the event. The pieces were showcased in a display in the University of Alberta Hospital then collected for the evening event. Food and beverages were supplied by the MHA group, with piano entertainment offered from several members of the medical student cohort.  </p>

                <i>Peer Support: </i>For the past couple of years, students have put together peer support sessions. They occur once or twice a month over lunch hour where students are free to attend or not (no commitment). It is an open-group where students go around and respond to a prompt for that day without fearing judgement. A safe place for people to air what is on their mind. Should anyone say something that gives others cause for concern regarding their mental health the lead of the session is free to direct the student to Student Services.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Blue Monday: </i>A new event put on by a member of our MMSA. The 3rd Monday of January is noted to be “Blue Monday” the most depressing day of the year. We held our event one week later so it was the 3rd Monday back to school. This year we handed out little bags of chocolates with wellness resource business cards to every member of the pre-clerkship classes during their morning classes. This was followed up by a relaxing board game night that evening! We did not advertise this event as “Blue Monday,” but instead as a random wellness day to pick up spirits!

            <p>I really like this free, self-paced online course on the science of happiness. I find a lot of their videos and reading materials very motivating and easy to follow. They talk a lot about mindfulness, cooperation, empathy and compassion, as well as forgiveness and what happiness actually means. It is focused on the positive side of things and I find the information presented there very useful for my personal life and even clinical interactions with patients. </p>

            <p>I love the sleep cycle app. Clerkship can be tough and exhausting and one thing that really did help me was getting myself to sleep more. This app analyzes your sleep and also wakes you up in your lightest phase. Though I have only started using it recently, I have felt much more rested in the morning and throughout the day which has positively contributed to my mental health. </p>
