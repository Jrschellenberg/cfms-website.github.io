			<p>At CFMS, we have an exclusive partnership with <a href="https://mdm.ca/">MD Financial Management</a> to provide medical students with comprehensive financial planning, financial education and a wide range of support for events and services, including the leadership and travel awards.</p>
			<p>Owned by the Canadian Medical Association, MD’s only business imperative is to enhance the financial outcomes of physicians by focusing on their distinctive needs and operating in their best interests.</p>
			<p>MD has a team of MD Advisors and Early Career Specialists called <a href="https://mdm.ca/contact-us/meded.asp">MD MedEd Counsel<sup>TM</sup></a> dedicated to supporting medical students and residents, whether it’s budgeting, cash flow management, finding the right credit solution or other strategies.</p>

			<h2>Financial Checklist for Medical Students</h2>
			<p>With the high cost of tuition and living expenses, medical school can be challenging from a financial perspective. In fact, nine of every 10 medical students will incur debt by the end of their medical education.</p>
			<p>Here are <strong>six steps</strong> you can take to ensure you come out ahead:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Meet with an MD Advisor
					<p>Medical students assume because they often have little or no financial wealth that they don’t need financial advice. But financial planning involves more than accumulating assets. An MD Advisor can assess your situation and develop a financial plan so you can graduate with as little debt as possible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Determine your financing needs and obtain funding
					<p>If you need financial assistance, be sure to apply for scholarships and bursaries, and get student loans from the government. You can also <a href="https://mdm.ca/career-stages/student/paying-for-medical-school/">apply for a Medical Student and Resident Line of Credit</a> to pay for your medical school and other living expenses. Be sure to create your cash flow and budget so that you can lower your medical school debt.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Take control of your financial health
					<p>Establishing a budget, cash flow and/or savings plan will go a long way in helping you <a href="https://mdm.ca/career-stages/student/managing-debt/">manage your debt</a>, protect your credit, manage savings, and meet financial goals. There are <a href="https://mdm.ca/wealth-management/investment-management-strategy/investor-education/">tools you can use</a> to stay on top of your financial well-being.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Consider the car and home options 
					<p>Transportation can have a big impact on your finances. If you’re thinking about buying and financing a car, an advisor can help you weigh the options and come to a decision.</p>
					<p>Most students will rent during medical school, but depending on your situation, buying a home may be a viable option. An MD Advisor can walk you through the <a href="https://mdm.ca/career-stages/resident/renting-vs-owning-a-home/">rent vs. buy decision</a>, and refer you to mortgage specialists.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Protect yourself with insurance
					<p>Your ability to earn future income as a resident and practising physician is your most important asset. An MD Advisor can help you develop a plan to protect your family, property and earning potential, and ensure the coverage is always aligned with your needs and career stage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Assemble a team of financial experts
					<p>If you need assistance from other financial experts, an MD Advisor will be able to provide referrals to lawyers, mortgage specialists, insurance specialists and estate and trust specialists.
					</p>
				</li>
