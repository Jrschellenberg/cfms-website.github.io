      The University of British Columbia's Faculty of Medicine has a 50-year
      tradition of providing outstanding student-centered classroom and clinical
      training. Our students benefit from innovative, evidence-based teaching and
      learning in an environment that fosters excellence in research and
      healthcare.

      Beginning in the fall of 2004, more students will have the opportunity to
      pursue a career in medicine—and more BC students will be able to study
      closer to their own communities. In recognition of the urgent need for more
      doctors in the province, particularly in the Island and Northern
      communities, the Government of British Columbia announced the expansion of
      BC’s medical school with a mandate to double enrolment of first-year
      students from 128 to 256 by 2010. Enrolment in 2004 will increase by 72
      students, to 200.

    school-description: "The Northern Ontario School of Medicine opened its doors to the Charter Class in September 2005 and is the newest medical school in Canada in over thirty years. NOSM is a joint initiative of Laurentian and Lakehead Universities with co-campuses in Sudbury and Thunder Bay as well as dozens of teaching sites distributed throughout Northern Ontario. \nFirst and second year students are based primarily in either Sudbury or Thunder Bay. During this time there are also three mandatory month-long experiences in rural and remote communities including one First Nations reservation. Third year clerks are based in large rural and small urban communities for an innovative longitudinal comprehensive community  clerkship (CCC). These communities include Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins, North Bay, Sioux Lookout, Parry Sound and others. Fourth year students return to Sudbury and Thunder Bay for more traditional-style rotations through the core discipines. Opportunities for electives throughout Canada and the world are also available. \nThe curriculum is objective-based and small-group-focused with supplementary whole group sessions and labs each week. Early clinical and community exposure is emphasized, along with social determinants of health, and Aboriginal and Francophone health issues. Small class sizes and individual attention are a key feature of the curriculum, especially in weekly structured clinical skills sessions. \nThe guiding values of the medical school are: (1) a passion for living in, working in and serving northern urban, rural and remote communities (2) sensitivity to diversity (3) excellence in medical practice, teaching, learning and professionalism. \nThe MD program at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine is four years in length. At completion of the program, graduates will have earned an MD degree equivalent to all other Canadian medical schools. Graduates of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine will be ready and able to undertake postgraduate training anywhere in Canada; however, they will have a special affinity for training and clinical practice in northern urban, rural and remote communities."

Programs include agriculture, arts, humanities, social sciences, commerce, education, kinesiology, fine arts, physical sciences, engineering, health sciences, medicine, dentistry, physical therapy, pharmacy, nutrition, nursing, and veterinary medicine. \nThe university is a focus for athletics and cultural activities in Saskatoon, a city of 200,000 located along the banks of the South Saskatchewan River. U of S \"Huskies\" compete in 15 sports, providing an exciting opportunity to watch Canada's best amateur athletes in action. University faculty, staff and students are active in Saskatoon events like \"Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan\" and the Fringe. \nWith more than half of all first and second-year classes enrolling 25 or fewer students, class size is one of the University of Saskatchewan's most important features. The university is also a Canadian leader in providing support and enhancement programs for Aboriginal students in education, law, commerce, arts and sciences, and engineering. \nAnnual research revenues for University of Saskatchewan faculty recently topped more than $100 million. The university is also the centre of an active community of federal and provincial research agencies and private research companies. \nThe Canadian Light Source, Canada's only synchrotron radiation facility, will begin operation in 2004. The CLS will attract more than 2,000 researchers annually from around Canada and the world, and will be a magnet for top students in a variety of disciplines, including agriculture, biochemistry, chemistry, electronics, geology, materials, medicine, pharmacology and physics. The Chemical Engineering addition, to be completed in May 2002, will include a pilot plant that allows simulation of processes used in industry. New space is also being constructed for the Saskatchewan Structural Science Centre. Construction of a new kinesiology building is also under way with features including a triple gym with seating for 2,500, an elevated walking and jogging track, a 1,300 square metre fitness centre and a rock-climbing wall in the main foyer. At the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, completion of an addition to house a Magnetic Resonance Imaging unit and cobalt radiation therapy equipment is expected shortly, making it the only veterinary teaching hospital in Canada with an MRI dedicated to pets and the only facility in western Canada able to provide radiation therapy for animal cancer patients."

    school-description: "The Northern Ontario School of Medicine opened its doors to the Charter Class in September 2005 and is the newest medical school in Canada in over thirty years. NOSM is a joint initiative of Laurentian and Lakehead Universities with co-campuses in Sudbury and Thunder Bay as well as dozens of teaching sites distributed throughout Northern Ontario. \nFirst and second year students are based primarily in either Sudbury or Thunder Bay. During this time there are also three mandatory month-long experiences in rural and remote communities including one First Nations reservation. Third year clerks are based in large rural and small urban communities for an innovative longitudinal comprehensive community  clerkship (CCC). These communities include Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins, North Bay, Sioux Lookout, Parry Sound and others. Fourth year students return to Sudbury and Thunder Bay for more traditional-style rotations through the core discipines. Opportunities for electives throughout Canada and the world are also available. \nThe curriculum is objective-based and small-group-focused with supplementary whole group sessions and labs each week. Early clinical and community exposure is emphasized, along with social determinants of health, and Aboriginal and Francophone health issues. Small class sizes and individual attention are a key feature of the curriculum, especially in weekly structured clinical skills sessions. \nThe guiding values of the medical school are: (1) a passion for living in, working in and serving northern urban, rural and remote communities (2) sensitivity to diversity (3) excellence in medical practice, teaching, learning and professionalism. \nThe MD program at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine is four years in length. At completion of the program, graduates will have earned an MD degree equivalent to all other Canadian medical schools. Graduates of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine will be ready and able to undertake postgraduate training anywhere in Canada; however, they will have a special affinity for training and clinical practice in northern urban, rural and remote communities."
