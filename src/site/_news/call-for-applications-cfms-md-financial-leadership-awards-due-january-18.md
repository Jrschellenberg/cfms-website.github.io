The CFMS and MD Financial Management want to recognize some of the passionate, dedicated and caring medical student leaders across Canada who have made innovative contributions to their schools and communities.

We broadly define leadership as accomplishments as a leader, collaborator, communicator, scholar, professional and/or health advocate.

In recognition of their achievements, one student from each of the 15 member schools of the Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) will receive a Medical Student Leadership Award. This award consists of:

A certificate of recognition

A cash prize of $2000

Subsidized travel to the awards reception at the CFMS Spring General Meeting in Niagara Falls on April 11-13th, 2019

More information and the application are available&nbsp;[here](https://www.cfms.org/resources/md-leadership-awards.html). You will need to log in with your CFMS account.

The applications require a CV, personal letter, reference letters and letter of good standing from your institution. Applications are due January 18th 2019 at 11:59pm EST.
