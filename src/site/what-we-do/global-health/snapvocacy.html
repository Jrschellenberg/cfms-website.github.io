                                <li class="exec-desc"><span><strong>What are the legal barriers that refugees and migrants face that directly or indirectly impact health?</strong>“A person’s immigration status in Canada can impact their physical and mental well-being in many ways. To begin, access to health insurance to cover health services is dependent on one’s immigration status. Canadian citizens and permanent residents are entitled to provincial health care. Refugee claimants, including failed refugee claimants, are entitled to Interim Federal Health, which provides them with access to basic health care services but is not as broad as provincial health insurance programs. People who have temporary status in Canada (visitors, students, workers with short term work permits) are not entitled to provincial health insurance and are expected to pay for their health care needs. Likewise, people without any status in Canada are not entitled to health government funded insurance coverage. Lack of and/or limited health insurance means that refugees and migrants will often access health services only when their health is in crisis.<br>A person’s lack of immigration status can also impact on their physical and mental health other ways. The length of time it can take to regularize one’s immigration status in Canada can take a toll on a person’s health as they worry and wait to obtain status. Unfortunately, the resulting deterioration of a refugee claimant’s physical and mental health can also affect their ability to obtain status. For example, refugee claimants whose mental health deteriorates as they wait for their hearing before the Immigration and Refugee Board may have a harder time testifying in the hearing room. This can have a negative impact on their credibility and potentially affect the outcome of their refugee claim.<br>Finally, separation from loved ones can also have an impact on a person’s mental and physical health. I have many clients who were determined to be Convention refugees in Canada and who, when they applied for permanent residence, included their dependence overseas. Because their loved ones are often in a precarious situation back home, the worry and anxiety my clients have while they wait to be reunited with their family members can have an impact on their physical and mental well-being.” <br><br><i>Laila Demirdache, Immigration and Refugee Lawyer</i></span></li>

                    <p><strong>What are the different immigration classes in which people can be accepted into Canada?</strong><br>Refugees make up a small number of the immigrants to Canada along with economic immigrants, family class and a small number of “other”</p>
                    <p><strong>What does it mean to be a refugee?</strong><br>1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees:</p>

                        <li>a person owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted</li>
                        <li>for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion</li>
                        <li>is outside the country of their nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail him/herself of the protection of that country</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: this definition does not include Internally Displaced Persons (IDP’s), those that have fled situations that may be very similar to refugees but have not crossed international borders.</p>
