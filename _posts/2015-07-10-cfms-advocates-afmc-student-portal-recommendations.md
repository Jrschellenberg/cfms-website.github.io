With the launch of the AFMC Student Portal, the CFMS has strived to ensure that we are providing timely feedback to the AFMC and that this service is updated to meet the needs of our membership. The CFMS has worked to implement a feedback collection system.  Students can send concerns about the electives booking process to [portalfeedback@cfms.org](mailto:portalfeedback@cfms.org).

The CFMS Portal Feedback tool received a total of 283 suggestions between January and June 2015 that were compiled into a series of 19 recommendations which we delivered to the AFMC.  We will keep our members updated of the progress towards implementing our recommendations!

Special thanks to our Western Regional Representative [John Schulte](mailto:jps279@campus.usask.ca) who represents the CFMS to the AFMC Student Portal Steering Committee and Enhancements Working Group and works tirelessly to advocate for students interests as it pertains to electives in Canada.
