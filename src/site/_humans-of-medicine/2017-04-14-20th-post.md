“I wanted to be a fighter pilot. My dream was to attend the military college, to complete flight training and to then fly one of Canada’s CF-18’s. As I matured, I decided to change that plan a little bit. It then changed a little more. Until finally, I realized I wanted something completely different; a career in medicine. As I now advance in my clerkship training, I see many of the technical and procedural aspects of flying re-emerging in my life through surgical training. I now want to be a Pediatric Surgeon, but I’ve learned that dreams change, often unexpectedly!”
