**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Press Release to accompany AFMC Board Meeting on Physician Wellness and Burnout**

**OTTAWA, APRIL 28th, 2018** - The CFMS is proud to have launched our National Wellness Program this weekend. This is our comprehensive approach to supporting student wellness and working with programs to ensure learner wellness is a core value we hold across all of the work that we do.

The national wellness program has 4 major threads: Advocacy, Programming, Awareness and Resiliency and Personal Development. There are a number of new threads that we have launched as part of this including our Longitudinal Wellness Initiative, which focuses on developing student wellness in the areas of nutrition, mental, financial, physical and social/relationship wellness. We have also created two new files focused on student mistreatment and students with disabilities to ensure we address systemic issues related to the learner environment.

The CFMS also joined the AFMC, Resident Doctors of Canada and our faculties of medicine for an engaging discussion on physician/learner wellness and burnout. The session involved a thought-provoking presentation from Dr. Gautam who highlighted data on physician burnout and factors that drive the current crises. &nbsp;The core work happened in small group discussion where we set a direction for the future and considered priorities for charting a new course on physician wellness and burnout.

The CFMS representatives who attended the meeting highlighted the importance of a coordinated effort between UGME, SA, PGME, learner organizations, and all other stakeholders in developing comprehensive approaches to improving the physician wellness and addressing burnout rates among our profession. We highlighted the importance of health-promoting learning environments; that is an educational experience that supports and promotes health and well-being. From educational policies to scheduling and curriculum there are significant strides we must make to ensure we are prioritizing health. Wellness is and must be a core part of the learner experience discussion, it must be a value we hold, not an afterthought once academic standards have been addressed. We look forward to a report being released and will continue to work with stakeholders and advocate for learner wellness.
