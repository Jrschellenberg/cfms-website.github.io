The CFMS Committee of Health Policy welcomes students to apply for the National Clinical Neurosciences Task Force. This task force is dedicated to advocating for changes within medical education and policy regarding the clinical neurosciences, be they anything from psychiatric to neurosurgical.

This year, the task force will be addressing the lack of coverage of myoelectric prostheses as well as more technologically advanced prosthetics. These devices are sold for tens of thousands of dollars, often crippling middle-class families attempting to purchase these. While advances in the field of prosthesis and neuroprosthesis are made, the foundations for providing even low-grade care are not laid—health care and insurance coverage for these devices is extremely poor. As advances are made, we are helping lay the foundations to be built upon, allowing people access to life-changing care. This task force will also be planning an approach to Clinical Neuroscience-related issues across Canada and undertaking these initiatives.

The task force is currently looking for leaders within the clinical neurosciences or within the field of prosthesis to begin the creation of a position paper to guide the CFMS’ position on this topic while also leading an advocacy campaign lobbying for this to be covered under health care or in some other way made more accessible.&nbsp;

**Applications are due August 10th, 2018 by 5 pm ET.** Apply [here](https://goo.gl/forms/xjav0kAEx4ZXZarG2).

Questions may be directed to the CFMS National Officer of Health Policy, Syeda Shanza Hashmi, at [nohp@cfms.org](mailto:nohp@cfms.org).
