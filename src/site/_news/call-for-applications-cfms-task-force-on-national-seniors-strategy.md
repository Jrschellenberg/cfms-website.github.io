In accordance to the resolution passed at SGM 2017, “Promotion of a National Senior’s Care Strategy”, the CFMS Committee of Health Policy opens a call for applications for involvement in the task force that will address this specific topic.

This resolution was created to address the need for a national strategy for palliative and end-of-life care, in consideration of the struggles faced by the geriatric population. Seniors are projected to comprise one quarter of the Canadian population by 2036, and so, it is of utmost important for CFMS to prioritise the creating of partnerships with organisations in calling for stronger educational supports, resources, and advocacy in developing a National Senior’s Care Strategy.&nbsp;

If interested, **please [apply](https://goo.gl/forms/rdz6OHw47cAdcW3i2 ) by April 20th at 5 PM (EST), 2018.**&nbsp;

Questions may be directed to the CFMS National Officer of Health Policy, Syeda Shanza Hashmi, at [nohp@cfms.org](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(110,111,104,112,64,99,102,109,115,46,111,114,103))).
