The CFMS Annual Review, an annual publication showcasing initiatives, research, projects, and creative talent from medical students across Canada, is calling for submissions. Share stories from your travels and clinical experiences. Tell us about your reflections, musings, and opinions. Show off your artistic talent, be it poetry, painting, or photography.

The Annual Review is circulated to readers across Canada, including medical students, medical school deans, medical organizations, provincial ministers of health, and members of parliament.

Please submit written articles of up to 800 words (reflection, opinion/editorial), as well as creative works (short stories, poems, artwork, photography). Photos from travels, electives abroad, newborns, and weddings are also encouraged! 

We are also seeking submissions for our cover art. You have the license to be creative through drawing, painting, digital art, photography, or any medium of your choosing. Ideally, the design for this year’s cover art will in some way include medical technology as a focus.

Submissions of all kinds can be sent to Connor Brenna, our Annual Review editor, at [annualreview@cfms.org](mailto:contributor@cfms.org). Submissions are due by January 18, 2019.
