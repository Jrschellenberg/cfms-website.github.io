As adolescence is a time of gradually gaining responsibilities, implementing the rights of adolescents specifically involves a dynamic process of striking a balance between protecting them while respecting their autonomy and promoting their empowerment. With this in mind, IPPF and WAS developed Fulfil! A Guidance Document for the Implementation of Young People&rsquo;s Sexual Right (2016). Join us in this exciting Symposium with experts on adolescent&rsquo;s health and sexual and reproductive health and rights.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cupop.formstack.com/forms/fulfill">https://cupop.formstack.com/forms/fulfill</a></p><p>Date and time: Friday April 21st 2017 from 4:00-5:30 pm</p><p>Link: email <a href="mailto:cprc@columbia.edu">cprc@columbia.edu</a> for livestream link</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li value="5"><strong>Summer School Opportunities in Angers, France</strong></li></ol><p>The University of Angers is pleased to announce the opening of registrations for their summer programs, which will be held&nbsp;<strong>from the 26th June to 7th July. 6 different options are available, including: research, simulation in healthcare, bioinformatics, vascular, tourism, </strong><strong>&eacute;thiques et sant&eacute;, enfance et bien-&ecirc;tre</strong><strong>, plant science. </strong>Each includes conferences by international and renowned researchers, workshops, hands-on activities, visits to research facilities and biotech companies, and attractive social activities.</p><p>For more information, as well as videos from previous summer school sessions: <u><a target="_blank" href="http://www.summerschools.univ-angers.fr/">www.summerschools.univ-<wbr />angers.fr</a></u></p><p>Question? <a target="_blank" href="mailto:international@anemf.org">international@anemf.org</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Deadline: April 16<sup>th</sup>, 2017</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6.&nbsp;<strong>WPATH Transgender Health Student Research Grant</strong></p><p>The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Student Initiative (WSI) is pleased to announce a research grant opportunity for students: two separate research grants of $500 to students beginning in Spring 2017 + the two recipients will be awarded 1-year free WPATH Student Membership.</p><p>Eligibility Requirements:</p><ul><li>Applicants may be a WPATH student member or a student who would be eligible to be a WPATH Student Member.
