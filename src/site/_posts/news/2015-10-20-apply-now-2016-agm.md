###**The CFMS is now accepting applications from our member schools to host the 2016 Annual General Meeting!**

Every year, one of the CFMS member schools hosts the CFMS AGM in or near the city of their medical school or its distributed campuses. This provides an excellent opportunity to increase the profile of your medical school/medical student society, increase CFMS awareness to students at your school, and a chance to host friends and colleagues from the CFMS in your hometown. 

**The deadline for applications to host AGM 2016 is December 5, 2015**. The CFMS Executive will review applications received by this date and the winning school will be announced December 12, 2015.

Included for your information is the <a href="/files/updates/CFMS_AGM_2016_-_Proposal_Request.pdf">Proposal Request</a> which outlines all items needed to put together a bid. We have also included the <a href="/files/updates/AGM_2016_Scoring_Matrix.pdf">Scoring Matrix</a> and the <a href="/files/updates/CFMS_Sponsorship_Policy.pdf">Sponsorship Policy</a> to help facilitate your application process. We can also provide an example of a previous bid upon request.

Any questions or concerns can be directed towards the CFMS Atlantic Regional Representative, Anthony Maher (<a href="mailto:atlantic@cfms.org">atlantic@cfms.org</a>). 

We look forward to receiving your bids!
