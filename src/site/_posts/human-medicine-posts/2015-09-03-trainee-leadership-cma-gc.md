There was impressive engagement from trainees at this year's CMA General Council in Halifax, NS.  We were excited to see an expansion in the CMA Ambassadors Program which brought 10 medical students, 10 residents, and 10 early career physicians from the region to attend General Council.

The CFMS was successful in bringing forward and passing two motions:

**Motion DM5-25** *(Durafourt, Lafreniere)*<br>
The Canadian Medical Association supports consistent immunization policies, health and safety requirements and standardized reporting for all medical schools in Canada.

**Motion DM5-11** *(Durafourt, Teja)*<br>
The Canadian Medical Association supports in principle the right of Canadian medical students and medical residents to vote in the election of their medical association representative.

In addition, there were several other motions brought forward by medical students from across Canada - a sign of an engaged medical student membership at the CMA.
