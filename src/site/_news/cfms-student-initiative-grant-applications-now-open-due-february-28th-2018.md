The CFMS Student Initiative Grants Program was established in 2007 to provide support and funding to medical student initiatives. The fund was established in response to the increasing number of medical student-run initiatives and the need for official and financial support from our national student organization.

For more information about the grants and how your application will be scored, please see the Student Initiative Grants [page](https://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/student-affairs/student-initiative-grants.html).

Many successful projects have benefitted from direct CFMS funding including charitable, educational, and social events all organized by medical students. The goal is to assist students in realizing events or initiatives that promote interactions between CFMS students and member schools.

**Brief Project Guidelines:**

Student Initiative Grant funding is intended to help local and provincial start-up projects with initial funding to contribute to their long-term sustainability.

Projects will NOT be considered if they have been recipients of CFMS Student Initiative Grants in the last 5 years.

Projects will receive a maximum funding amount of $3000.

*Please do not increase your budget to ask for this maximum, as we wish to fund as many projects as possible; however, for projects with a larger budget, please be aware that you are expected to seek funding from other sources, such that the project may be completed with only partial funding from the CFMS.*

*The Student Initiative Grants Program is NOT meant to fund academic research or travel funding to conferences for individual medical students.*
