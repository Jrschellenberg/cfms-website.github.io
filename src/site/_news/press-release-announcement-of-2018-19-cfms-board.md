**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Toronto, ON October 13th, 2018​​** - The Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) is very excited to have had the opportunity to attend and present at the International Conference of Physician Health (ICPH) this past week in Toronto.

Sponsored by the CMA, 25 students leaders from across Canada, including many CFMS members kicked things off with the CMA wellness ambassador pre-conference workshop day on Wednesday October 10th. It was a powerful day of fulsome discussion and collaboration. A major highlight for all participants was the advocacy training componen. We look forward to staying connected with the CMA and the Wellness Ambassadors moving forward.

Thursday the main conference kicked off with an excellent plenary by Dr. Anthony Suchman, which included all 500+ participants singing “Kumbaya”. Dr, Suchman emphasized the need for systems-level change in medicine. The rest of the day was filled with excellent workshops and small-group presentations which we took many important learnings from.

On Friday we had the opportunity to present our innovative work on the development and implementation of the National Wellness Program to a full audience! Our work was very well received and we received awesome feedback and built additional collaborations that will help us further the program. There was also a panel discussion on implementing wellness as a competency in medical education, highlighted by Dr. Debbie Cohen, who gave an impassioned talk highlighting the key of focusing on culture through prioritizing the values of respect, compassion, appreciation and positive emotions.

The conference drew to a close on Saturday with an international panel discussing challenges to systems change. Our CMA president, Dr. Gigi Osler laid out her vision for creating a more positive culture in medicine which included medical training programs that were held to accreditation standards around health and wellness and breaking down all barriers for physician access to health and wellness supports. Her leadership and advocacy on this front is truly inspiring.

ICPH 2018 was an inspiring gathering of leaders in physician wellness. As an organization we gained much knowledge, positive experiences and future collaborations through being a part of the conference. Now to roll up our sleeves and continue to work on building our National Wellness Program; prioritizing further development in our pillars of advocacy, awareness, personal development & resilience and programming. We look forward also to developing

further collaboration with the CMA and Resident Doctors of Canada on wellness initiatives. This work is about you; its about building a positive health-promoting learning and working environment for us and future students.
