            <h3 id="ottawa"><strong>Ottawa</strong></h3>
            <p>At uOttawa, we have had a few great initiatives run by our own Student Wellness Committee as well as events run through several of our student run interest groups that help to promote nutrition and healthy lifestyle within our faculty.</p>
            <p>As a Student Wellness Committee, we ran a salad potluck as part of the CFMS Wellness month nutrition week. We used one of the small student rooms during lunch time in which students who wanted to take part in the event were asked to bring one component of a salad (ex. Spinach, cut up cucumber, tomatoes, peppers, etc.). Dressing or oil and vinegar was provided. To keep it green, we asked students to bring their own tupperware and fork and students mixed their own preference of ingredients. It was a very simple and easy to run initiative that was a nice way to provide a healthy lunch as well as bring students of different years together.</p>

            <p>We also have a Weight Management interest group that focuses on providing students with resources and knowledge about weight management care and obesity management through lunchtime talks and events. We also have a Medical Students Promoting Nutrition interest group that runs a wide range of talks and initiatives that not only promote healthy eating and exercise amongst medical students, but also introduces the importance of nutrition and exercise to elementary school students.</p>

            <p>Stone salads have been a success at Dalhousie University. We have been offering them weekly throughout CFMS Wellness month and are looking at continuing them for the rest of the year! Stone salad is a great way to build comradarie and get your veggie fix at the same time.</p>
            <p>A sign-up sheet is posted where people volunteer to bring different ingredients (either a salad green, a vegetable, a protein, a sauce or a topping) to be used in salad making. Each person combines their own choice of ingredients. Recommended using a minimum of 6 people with no maximum, and they are hosted in our school lounge!</p>
            <p>Prior to exams, it's Dal tradition for the Med1 and Med2 class to host a reciprocal potluck for the class with an exam. The potlucks are a huge help to supplement our nutrition and boost vegetable intake when it gets down to crunch time.</p>

            <p>Dalhousie Wellness week in March will also offer some nutrition initiates. We have a stone salad planned as well as a grocery store tour with a dietitian and a cooking class to learn how to prepare a healthy, home-cooked meal.</p>

            <p>Oh She Glows is an online blog and cookbook that focuses on plant-based recipes and uses real, whole food ingredients. Aside from the amazing photography that accompanies each recipe, I love that the recipes are healthy, colourful, and filling. There is so much variety on this website, that no matter what I feel like cooking, I can always find an Oh She Glows healthy recipe for it!</p>

            <p>The instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bodyby.becca/?hl=en">@bodyby.becca</a> focuses on both fitness and nutrition. I love the recipes because they use a variety of natural ingredients, are high in protein, and are all super healthy. I love getting new ideas for pre and post workout snacks. Her workout tutorials are also unique, fun and easy to follow, so you can eat well and be fit!

            <p>I was looking for resources for patients one day and came across this website. I find it very helpful credible source of information and I subscribed to the Harvard Chan School of Public Health newsletter. It often brings interesting news on nutrition and healthy recipes. For example, they sent great tips on how to avoid overeating and how to make healthy holiday dishes before Christmas, new research of common food products and advice on proper preparation. </p>
