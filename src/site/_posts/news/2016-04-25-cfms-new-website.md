After months of internal development, the CFMS is proud to announce the release of our new website. We've heard from a number of our members that our previous website has been slow and difficult to navigate, and our new site aims to address many of these problems. A few of our new features are listed below:

# **Easier to navigate**
The new CFMS website is designed to make it easier to find resources and information without having to hunt through multiple menus.

# **Improved design**
An improved colour scheme, layout, and graphic design make the new website more attractive and professional.

# **Supports mobile devices**
The website adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, including those of tablets and mobile phones.

# **Improved performance**
The new CFMS website is approximately 5 times faster than the old site, and requires less data to download.

## **What's Next?**
A number of features are still being rolled out while the website migration takes place. Many features, including member logins, and discounts, are still only available on the old website (now available at: [old.cfms.org](http://old.cfms.org)). If there are any concerns or suggestions, feel free to email [it@cfms.org](mailto:it@cfms.org). *We hope you enjoy using our new site!*
