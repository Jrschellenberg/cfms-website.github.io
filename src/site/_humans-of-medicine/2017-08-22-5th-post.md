"I was born in a small town in Ukraine called Nezhin so if growing up someone were to tell me that just a couple of decades later I would be living in Canada and studying to become a medical doctor I probably would have called them crazy! This is something I try to keep in mind and reflect upon once in a while. I am eternally grateful for the opportunities that I have been afforded over the years and I will, therefore, strive to assist others on their journeys as countless people have helped me on my own."

- Pavel Yarmak, Medical Student (University of Manitoba)
