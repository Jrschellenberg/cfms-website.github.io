“Medicine… it’s what I’ve dreamed about doing, and now I’m here! Working in a hospital, seeing the sickest of the sickest patients and learning about all the research going on… who could ask for anything more? Until I realized that I also dreamed about Sunday sing-alongs with my family, about taking my kids to soccer practice, about taking a couple weeks off to travel to Portugal every summer. It’s hard at 23 to imagine my future, but I’m trying my best to find a path that lets me live out both dreams.”
