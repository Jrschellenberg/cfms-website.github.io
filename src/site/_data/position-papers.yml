          paper-summary: >-
            The ratio of available residency spots to Canadian medical
            students has declined steadily since 2009, and the number of
            unmatched medical students has increased. The CFMS endorses: 1)
            Unmatched graduates of Canadian medical students are an
            inappropriate outcome of the match process 2) For every 100
            Canadian medical student applicants there should be 120 residency
            spots, as per the Canadian Medical Association (CMA)
            recommendations 3) Every Canadian medical school must develop
            deliberate and well-considered policies to support unmatched
            medical students.

            Human trafficking is a relevant concern for Canadian HCP with
            severe effects on health and wellbeing of victims. Medical
            students and HCP are not adequately trained to recognize and
            assist victims. This paper advocates for curriculum incorporation
            of elements of raising awareness, providing validated screening
            tools and teaching how to identify and counsel vulnerable
            populations.

          paper-link: /files/position-papers/2016_advocacy and leadership.pdf
          paper-summary: >-
            In light of the need for medical students to develop their
            advocacy and leadership skills to be better prepared to advocate
            for the health needs of the patients and populations they serve,
            this paper calls for the creation of a mandatory Advocacy and
            Leadership Curriculum (ALC) in Canadian medical schools. This
            document is intended as a comprehensive resource for the CFMS and
            its members to support the integration and evaluation of ALCs in
            Canadian medical schools to enhance their social accountability.
            This paper includes proposed curriculum details such as the three
            spheres of health advocacy (patient level, institution level, and
            population level), advocacy preceptors, and health advocacy
            projects. Moreover, this paper includes several theoretical,
            skill-based, and application-based Learning Objectives that ALCs
            should address; a sample curriculum; sample competencies; and
            proposed implementation and evaluation guidelines.

            As of March 2016: While many medical students learn about the
            social determinants of health, little is taught in medical schools
            about the advocacy and leadership skills needed to act on this
            understanding of social issues in medicine. Some medical schools
            have faculty-supported advocacy curricula (e.g., the LEAD program
            at the University of Toronto) and some student-led health advocacy
            activities currently exist (e.g., lobby days). However, there is
            still a pressing need for increased social accountability in
            medical schools.

            Climate change and global health: Training future physicians to
            act and mitigate
          paper-publish-date: '2016'
          paper-link: /files/position-papers/2016_climate change and gh training.pdf
          paper-summary: >-
            Climate change poses several indirect hazards to human health,
            such as increasing incidence of vector-borne infectious diseases,
            cardio-respiratory related conditions and similar non-communicable
            diseases, as well as major disturbances to food and water systems.
            At particularly high risk are vulnerable populations such as the
            Inuit, who continue to witness firsthand current effects of
            climate change on their personal and ecosystem health. This is
            seen in greater trauma-related physical hazards due to melting
            ice, decreased stability of infrastructure due to melting
            permafrost, food insecurity, increased exposure to infectious
            disease through the sudden introduction of invasive species, water
            shortages and potential malnourishment. Meanwhile, direct impact
            of heat and air quality will likely be highest in Vancouver and
            Toronto, where annual cost of premature mortality risk
            attributable to climate change is expected to add up to $6.2
            billion annually. Mitigation measures such as air quality control
            can result in health co-benefits that offset cost of carbon
            policies by 1050%, whereas infrastructure modifications such as
            public transportation and urban settlement can further decrease
            risks of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and
            cardiovascular diseases.
          paper-status: >-
            The health community, through public and private institutions, is
            currently focusing on four overarching adaptions: researching
            health effects of climate change (through Health Canada, Canadian
            universities, etc.), activities at the federal, regional and
            health institutional level that directly or indirectly protect
            health, assessments of current levels of health adaptions in
            response to climate change, and communication of climate change
            health risks to the public. Health professionals who have
            participated in climate change advocacy have made significant
            contributions towards mitigation measures, such as air pollution
            research led by the CMA resulting in the decision to the phase out
            of coal-fired electricity in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta.
            Furthermore, health professionals have been involved in building
            assessment tools for tracking levels of health adaptions in
            response to climate change, such as the Air Quality Health Index
            (AQHI), heat alert response systems, and health vulnerability
            assessments. However, more work could be done to assess the
            effectiveness of such adaptions. At the undergraduate and
            postgraduate level in medical education, environmental health is
            one of the learning objects in Canadian medical education, but is
            not comprehensively explored. A successful example to look at when
            modelling climate change related medical education may include the
            work of the Sustainable Healthcare Education Network, which is a
            group of clinicians, students and academics in the UK dedicated to
            preparing health professionals for working in a low carbon health
            system.

            Less is More: Integration of Resource Stewardship in Medical
            Education

            medical education.pdf
          paper-summary: >-
            Resource stewardship is a concept focused on improving the quality
            of patient care by reducing the use of unnecessary medical testing
            and treatment, which is associated with false positives, increased
            patient anxiety, and preventable patient harm. As physicians
            control 80% of healthcare costs, it is crucial for medical
            students to learn and adopt practices in alignment of resource
            stewardship principles. The CFMS recognizes the importance of
            integrating resource stewardship into medical school curricula,
            and has created a list of behavioral recommendations for trainees
            aimed at creating a medical culture that celebrates the attitude
            of “less is more.” Going forward, there exists many opportunities
            to promote and support student-led initiatives focused on resource
            stewardship.
          paper-status: >-
            The University of Toronto has been a pioneer in the incorporation
            of resource stewardship into their curriculum, working closely
            with Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) to integrate it within all four
            years of their MD program. Other schools have also begun to do so,
            with many initatives being championed by students, such as the
            Students for Antimicrobial Stewardship Society. The CWC has also
            launched the STARS campaign, in which two medical students from
            each school are selected to champion the principles of resource
            stewardship at their school. In 2014, Canadian medical students
            and the CWC collaborated to create an online module for the
            Institute for Health Care Improvement titled "An Introduction to
            Quality, Value, and Cost in Health Care", which is the most
            popular non-mandatory module.

            This position paper summarizes the results of a nationwide survey
            on student perceptions of the Medical Student Performance Record
            (MSPR) document. Results were used to inform the recommendations
            put forward, which include: 1) Modification of the MSPR to
            minimize overlap with other CaRMS application documents, 2) Making
            medical students aware early in their training of the existence
            and prupose of the MSPR, and 3) Standardization of information
            collected on the MSPR by all medical schools across Canada

            A 2014 study (DOI: 10.3402/meo.v19.25181) on the heterogenity of
            information included on MSPR concluded that the information
            included in MSPR varied significantly between medical schools and
            concluded that standardization may be necessary in order for fair
            comparison to be made. However, no further action has been taken
            on this issue.

            Organ and Tissue Donation in Canadian Undergraduate Medical
            Education

            undergraduate medical education.pdf
          paper-summary: >-
            The Canadian organ and tissue donation system relies heavily on
            physicians, who 1) identify and refer possible donors; 2)
            sensitively approach the caregivers of the deceseased; and #)
            provide appropriate patient education about consenting to organ
            donation. However, meidcal students and physicians posess limited
            knowledge for maximixing procurement rates. Despite this, organ
            and tissue donation is notably absent from most Canadian medical
            school curricula, posing a significant risk to the safety of
            patients and the public. This paper recommends the integration of
            a standardized, evidence-based course on organ and tissue donation
            into undergraduate medical curricula across Canada, responding
            both to the relevant LMCC objectives and the need for physicians
            to be able to provide effective counselling of patients and
            families.

            "*Note that this paper is not categorized on the cfms website (it
            is only listed under the ""recently added"" papers). Likely a good
            fit for the ""Public Health"" category? The appendix of this paper
            includes an example of the 3 hour curriculum satisfying LMCC
            objectives on organ donation in Quebec, which is endorsed by a
            number of provincial and national organizations. This paper
            encouraged the implementation of a similar curriculum in medical
            schools across Canada. It is not known whether this has been
            implemented at other schools across Canada (this would be worth
            looking into but would require directly contacting the schools or
            students from each school). To the best of my knowledge there is
            not a similar curriculum at the University of Calgary (my medical
            school). "

          paper-summary: >-
            Rural areas in Canada face a double burden of decreased access to
            maternity care and increase in need (more pregnancies and often
            higher risk due to social factors. Low risk delivery locally in
            rural settings should be an option when possible. In order to
            improve rural and remote maternity care CFMS recommends (1)
            Promoting awareness and support for rural practice (2) Organizing
            mentorship for students interested in obstetrics/rural medicine
            (3) Encourage interprofessional and community collaboration to
            optimize future service delivery

          paper-summary: >-
            Given the important role that clinician-scientists play in
            advancing evidence-based medicine, clinician-scientist training in
            Canada should be strengthened. Challenges currently encountered by
            clinician-scientist trainees include financial barriers, length of
            training, and lack of mentorship. In order to help address these
            challenges and strengthen translational research in Canada, the
            CFMS should: (1) Support efforts to collect data on
            clinician-scientist training program enrollment and outcomes, in
            order to be able to make evidence-based decisions and thus more
            effectively administer clinician-scientist training programs; (2)
            Support the existing call for the CIHR to re-establish funding for
            MD/PhD trainees and create a national oversight body for
            clinician-scientist training programs; and (3) Support closer
            integration of clinician-scientist trainees with their colleagues
            in medical training during research phases of their training.

            As of Spring 2016: (1) The Clinician Investigator Trainee
            Association of Canada (CITAC), in collaboration with UBC and the
            Canadian Society for Clinical Investigation (CSCI), is currently
            in the process of collecting data that could help inform
            decision-making regarding the administration of
            clinician-scientist training programs. (2) Several organizations
            and programs across Canada are calling for the CIHR to either
            re-establish funding for the MD/PhD programs or create an
            alternative funding program.

          paper-summary: >-
            Paper is well written has the following recommendations pertaining
            to mental health and career development: 1) Canadian medical
            schools (and student-led organizations) should develop formal and
            informal wellness support initiatives. 2) Canadian medical
            faculties should promote safe learning environment for all medical
            students. 3) Medical schools should develop and promote
            accessible, realizable and standardized accomodation policies for
            medical students in each phase of UM training 4) Support research
            exploring wellness in learning and evaluation of mental health and
            wellness
          paper-status: >-
            The paper addresses a very current wide-spread concern at medical
            schools. There have been various school specific initiatives, but
            also province wide initiatives such as the Ontario medical
            students association's wellness retreat. There is a mental health
            communique at UofT, Faculty Wellness Program at UOttawa. I believe
            the next steps can be for the CFMS to endorse school specific
            mental health programs and by bringing light to them, encourage
            other schools/organizations to take part.

            This paper puts forward a number of policies on creating a safe
            and supportive learning environment for clinical clerks at
            Canadian medical schools. The three key recommendations advanced
            are: 1) Medical schools and hospitals should provide adequate
            resources to clerks to support learning, 2) Medical schools should
            support clerks in their personal and professional development, and
            3) Medical schools and hospitals should update their policies
            concerning the safety and security of clerks
          paper-status: >-
            The policies surrounding clerkship in Canada are medical
            school-specific, and there currently exists no national guidelines
            on the learning environment of clinical clerks in Canada

            Human trafficking is a relevant concern for Canadian HCP with
            severe effects on health and wellbeing of victims. Medical
            students and HCP are not adequately trained to recognize and
            assist victims. This paper advocates for curriculum incorporation
            of elements of raising awareness, providing validated screening
            tools and teaching how to identify and counsel vulnerable
            populations.

            In light of the need for medical students to develop their
            advocacy and leadership skills to be better prepared to advocate
            for the health needs of the patients and populations they serve,
            this paper calls for the creation of a mandatory Advocacy and
            Leadership Curriculum (ALC) in Canadian medical schools. This
            document is intended as a comprehensive resource for the CFMS and
            its members to support the integration and evaluation of ALCs in
            Canadian medical schools to enhance their social accountability.
            This paper includes proposed curriculum details such as the three
            spheres of health advocacy (patient level, institution level, and
            population level), advocacy preceptors, and health advocacy
            projects. Moreover, this paper includes several theoretical,
            skill-based, and application-based Learning Objectives that ALCs
            should address; a sample curriculum; sample competencies; and
            proposed implementation and evaluation guidelines.

            As of March 2016: While many medical students learn about the
            social determinants of health, little is taught in medical schools
            about the advocacy and leadership skills needed to act on this
            understanding of social issues in medicine. Some medical schools
            have faculty-supported advocacy curricula (e.g., the LEAD program
            at the University of Toronto) and some student-led health advocacy
            activities currently exist (e.g., lobby days). However, there is
            still a pressing need for increased social accountability in
            medical schools.

            Climate change and global health: Training future physicians to
            act and mitigate
          paper-publish-date: '2016'
          paper-link: /files/position-papers/2016_climate change and gh training.pdf
          paper-summary: >-
            Climate change poses several indirect hazards to human health,
            such as increasing incidence of vector-borne infectious diseases,
            cardio-respiratory related conditions and similar non-communicable
            diseases, as well as major disturbances to food and water systems.
            At particularly high risk are vulnerable populations such as the
            Inuit, who continue to witness firsthand current effects of
            climate change on their personal and ecosystem health. This is
            seen in greater trauma-related physical hazards due to melting
            ice, decreased stability of infrastructure due to melting
            permafrost, food insecurity, increased exposure to infectious
            disease through the sudden introduction of invasive species, water
            shortages and potential malnourishment. Meanwhile, direct impact
            of heat and air quality will likely be highest in Vancouver and
            Toronto, where annual cost of premature mortality risk
            attributable to climate change is expected to add up to $6.2
            billion annually. Mitigation measures such as air quality control
            can result in health co-benefits that offset cost of carbon
            policies by 1050%, whereas infrastructure modifications such as
            public transportation and urban settlement can further decrease
            risks of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and
            cardiovascular diseases.
          paper-status: >-
            The health community, through public and private institutions, is
            currently focusing on four overarching adaptions: researching
            health effects of climate change (through Health Canada, Canadian
            universities, etc.), activities at the federal, regional and
            health institutional level that directly or indirectly protect
            health, assessments of current levels of health adaptions in
            response to climate change, and communication of climate change
            health risks to the public. Health professionals who have
            participated in climate change advocacy have made significant
            contributions towards mitigation measures, such as air pollution
            research led by the CMA resulting in the decision to the phase out
            of coal-fired electricity in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta.
            Furthermore, health professionals have been involved in building
            assessment tools for tracking levels of health adaptions in
            response to climate change, such as the Air Quality Health Index
            (AQHI), heat alert response systems, and health vulnerability
            assessments. However, more work could be done to assess the
            effectiveness of such adaptions. At the undergraduate and
            postgraduate level in medical education, environmental health is
            one of the learning objects in Canadian medical education, but is
            not comprehensively explored. A successful example to look at when
            modelling climate change related medical education may include the
            work of the Sustainable Healthcare Education Network, which is a
            group of clinicians, students and academics in the UK dedicated to
            preparing health professionals for working in a low carbon health
            system.

            Less is More: Integration of Resource Stewardship in Medical
            Education

          paper-summary: >-
            Resource stewardship is a concept focused on improving the quality
            of patient care by reducing the use of unnecessary medical testing
            and treatment, which is associated with false positives, increased
            patient anxiety, and preventable patient harm. As physicians
            control 80% of healthcare costs, it is crucial for medical
            students to learn and adopt practices in alignment of resource
            stewardship principles. The CFMS recognizes the importance of
            integrating resource stewardship into medical school curricula,
            and has created a list of behavioral recommendations for trainees
            aimed at creating a medical culture that celebrates the attitude
            of “less is more.” Going forward, there exists many opportunities
            to promote and support student-led initiatives focused on resource
            stewardship.
          paper-status: >-
            The University of Toronto has been a pioneer in the incorporation
            of resource stewardship into their curriculum, working closely
            with Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) to integrate it within all four
            years of their MD program. Other schools have also begun to do so,
            with many initatives being championed by students, such as the
            Students for Antimicrobial Stewardship Society. The CWC has also
            launched the STARS campaign, in which two medical students from
            each school are selected to champion the principles of resource
            stewardship at their school. In 2014, Canadian medical students
            and the CWC collaborated to create an online module for the
            Institute for Health Care Improvement titled "An Introduction to
            Quality, Value, and Cost in Health Care", which is the most
            popular non-mandatory module.

            This position paper summarizes the results of a nationwide survey
            on student perceptions of the Medical Student Performance Record
            (MSPR) document. Results were used to inform the recommendations
            put forward, which include: 1) Modification of the MSPR to
            minimize overlap with other CaRMS application documents, 2) Making
            medical students aware early in their training of the existence
            and prupose of the MSPR, and 3) Standardization of information
            collected on the MSPR by all medical schools across Canada

            A 2014 study (DOI: 10.3402/meo.v19.25181) on the heterogenity of
            information included on MSPR concluded that the information
            included in MSPR varied significantly between medical schools and
            concluded that standardization may be necessary in order for fair
            comparison to be made. However, no further action has been taken
            on this issue.

            undergraduate medical education.pdf
          paper-summary: >-
            The Canadian organ and tissue donation system relies heavily on
            physicians, who 1) identify and refer possible donors; 2)
            sensitively approach the caregivers of the deceseased; and #)
            provide appropriate patient education about consenting to organ
            donation. However, meidcal students and physicians posess limited
            knowledge for maximixing procurement rates. Despite this, organ
            and tissue donation is notably absent from most Canadian medical
            school curricula, posing a significant risk to the safety of
            patients and the public. This paper recommends the integration of
            a standardized, evidence-based course on organ and tissue donation
            into undergraduate medical curricula across Canada, responding
            both to the relevant LMCC objectives and the need for physicians
            to be able to provide effective counselling of patients and
            families.

            includes an example of the 3 hour curriculum satisfying LMCC
            objectives on organ donation in Quebec, which is endorsed by a
            number of provincial and national organizations. This paper
            encouraged the implementation of a similar curriculum in medical
            schools across Canada. It is not known whether this has been
            implemented at other schools across Canada (this would be worth
            looking into but would require directly contacting the schools or
            students from each school). To the best of my knowledge there is
            not a similar curriculum at the University of Calgary (my medical
            school). "

            Given the important role that clinician-scientists play in
            advancing evidence-based medicine, clinician-scientist training in
            Canada should be strengthened. Challenges currently encountered by
            clinician-scientist trainees include financial barriers, length of
            training, and lack of mentorship. In order to help address these
            challenges and strengthen translational research in Canada, the
            CFMS should: (1) Support efforts to collect data on
            clinician-scientist training program enrollment and outcomes, in
            order to be able to make evidence-based decisions and thus more
            effectively administer clinician-scientist training programs; (2)
            Support the existing call for the CIHR to re-establish funding for
            MD/PhD trainees and create a national oversight body for
            clinician-scientist training programs; and (3) Support closer
            integration of clinician-scientist trainees with their colleagues
            in medical training during research phases of their training.

            faculties should promote safe learning environment for all medical
            students. 3) Medical schools should develop and promote
            accessible, realizable and standardized accomodation policies for
            medical students in each phase of UM training 4) Support research
            exploring wellness in learning and evaluation of mental health and

          paper-status: >-
            The paper addresses a very current wide-spread concern at medical
            schools. There have been various school specific initiatives, but
            also province wide initiatives such as the Ontario medical
            students association's wellness retreat. There is a mental health
            communique at UofT, Faculty Wellness Program at UOttawa. I believe
            the next steps can be for the CFMS to endorse school specific
            mental health programs and by bringing light to them, encourage
            other schools/organizations to take part.

            resources to clerks to support learning, 2) Medical schools should
            support clerks in their personal and professional development, and
            3) Medical schools and hospitals should update their policies
