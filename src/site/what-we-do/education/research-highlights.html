                        - Assessment driven learning has recently been revived as an important topic within education

                        -One might expect the effects of rehearsal to generalize to conceptually related, but distinct information
                        <br>
                        -This testing effect is transferable to related material that was not directly studied or studied but not tested (transfer)
                        <br>
                        -In a pilot study simulated to emulate real classroom scenarios, it was demonstrated that testing supports transfer of learning to new material but that the results varied depending on the organ system tested
                        <br>
                        -Secondary studies are currently being done to further understand this phenomenon
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        The notion that assessment can drive learning has recently been revived as an important topic within education. The very act of sitting a test can increase the memorability of the information being tested relative to repeated study of that information. What is not known is the mechanism through which testing creates this benefit and the extent to which the benefits gained generalize to other related material. This research tested the extent to which test enhanced learning benefits transfer to concepts that are related but not formally tested.

                        <br>
                        Results demonstrated that testing supports transfer of learning to new material but that the results varied depending on the organ system tested. Further analysis is currently being conducted to better understand our preliminary results. Conclusions of these studies will translate to improved restructuring of courses and ultimately towards academic success for medical students.

                        -There is an increasing need and use of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) in treating intracranial and spinal pathologies.
                        <br>
                        -Despite this, there is limited exposure to this modality in neurosurgical residency. For the field of neurosurgery to sustain its involvement in the provision of SRS planning and delivery, adequate training of neurosurgery residents in SRS is needed.
                        <br>
                        -This study was aimed to assess neurosurgery educatorsâ€™ views regarding the current state of Stereotactic Radiosurgery exposure, and to identify potential approaches to improve residency education in this domain.
                        <br>
                        - Of the 34 eligible participants, the overall response rate was 41.1% (14/34). This represents 9 of the 12 Canadian institutions surveyed - the majority of participants being current program directors. Most respondents (9/12) view an increasing role for SRS training in neurosurgery residency. 
                        <br>
                        -This analysis is timely as residency training is at a crossroads with the development of competency-based medical education.

                        <span style="font-weight:bold">In-Brief Explanation</span>
                        <br>
                        Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an integral component of neurosurgical practice. The indications for SRS as a minimally invasive tool in the treatment for neurosurgical pathologies continue to expand. Previous reports have emphasized that loss of neurosurgery leadership in SRS could jeopardize the field and compromise patient care. This study employed qualitative thematic analysis and constructivist grounded theory methodology in semi-structured phone interviews with current residency directors, past residency directors and departmental chairs across neurosurgical departments in Canada to assess their views regarding the current state of SRS training and exposure in residency. Unanimously, respondents endorse greater exposure to SRS during residency through formal residency rotations and engagement in interdisciplinary tumor boards to facilitate involvement in clinical decision-making. This analysis is timely as residency training is at a crossroads with the development of competency-based medical education.

                        The Ambassadors for Comprehensive Education (A.C.E.) Program is a student-led leadership initiative at McGill University. It is a committee aimed at improving education for medical students at all levels through peer-teaching activities and educational resources. Students relay their knowledge to their peers, while reinforcing their own understanding, promoting active rather than didactic learning. Our survey results reveal that our program is beneficial for academic preparation, stress reduction and bolstering studentsâ€™ interest in peer-teaching activities. In light of the results this innovative strategy has yielded, we promote the presence of peer-led teaching as a learning method in the medical curriculum.

                        -ME is a problem with the nervous system involving inflammation or a neuroinflammatory disorder. 
                        <br>
                        -In conducting a survey of 811 general practitioners, 48% were not confident in making a diagnosis of ME and 41% did not feel confident in providing treatment 
                        <br>
                        -In a 2013 study by Peterson et al., it was found that there were significant gaps in ME coverage within medical schools in the US.

                        -Leonard et al. reviewed 119 medical textbooks and found that only 0.09% of the pages had ME content.

                        This article will highlight the current gap in medical school curriculum content concerning Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and why itâ€™s a major issue. There is a need for advancing research about ME pathophysiology and treatment. This need must go hand in hand with educating students and healthcare professionals about ME.
