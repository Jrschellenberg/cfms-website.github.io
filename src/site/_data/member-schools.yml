  school-description: "The University of British Columbia's Faculty of Medicine has a 50-year tradition of providing outstanding student-centered classroom and clinical training. Our students benefit from innovative, evidence-based teaching and learning in an environment that fosters excellence in research and healthcare.
                       
                       							Beginning in the fall of 2004, more students will have the opportunity to pursue a career in medicine—and more BC students will be able to study closer to their own communities. In recognition of the urgent need for more doctors in the province, particularly in the Island and Northern communities, the Government of British Columbia announced the expansion of BC’s medical school with a mandate to double enrolment of first-year students from 128 to 256 by 2010. Enrolment in 2004 will increase by 72 students, to 200."

The CLS will attract more than 2,000 researchers annually from around Canada and the world, and will be a magnet for top students in a variety of disciplines, including agriculture, biochemistry, chemistry, electronics, geology, materials, medicine, pharmacology and physics. The Chemical Engineering addition, to be completed in May 2002, will include a pilot plant that allows simulation of processes used in industry. New space is also being constructed for the Saskatchewan Structural Science Centre. Construction of a new kinesiology building is also under way with features including a triple gym with seating for 2,500, an elevated walking and jogging track, a 1,300 square metre fitness centre and a rock-climbing wall in the main foyer. At the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, completion of an addition to house a Magnetic Resonance Imaging unit and cobalt radiation therapy equipment is expected shortly, making it the only veterinary teaching hospital in Canada with an MRI dedicated to pets and the only facility in western Canada able to provide radiation therapy for animal cancer patients."
