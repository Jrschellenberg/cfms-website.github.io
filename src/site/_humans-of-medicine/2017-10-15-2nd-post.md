"Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me" is one of my favourite non-medical books. Mindy Kaling never fails to be the female role model I need. Feminine, fantastic, confident, and funny. I was given her book by one of my close friends during the time I was applying for medical school. Kaling writes about becoming successful at a young age and how the hard work is always worth it, but that you have to adjust your lifestyle to be successful in the areas that you want - this resonated with me then and now, and holds true. Two quotes from Kaling are some of my favourite words to try and live by: "Someday you will have the power to make a difference in the world, so use it well" & "Sometimes you just have to put on lipgloss and pretend to be psyched".
