        <p><em><strong>How should I approach social media?</strong></em><br>Social media can seem overwhelming! There are many mediums through which to communicate your idea and it is difficult to know where to start. Each organization or advocacy cause will require different tools and you will have to tailor your approach to best achieve your goals. In the following section, we will provide you with a general overview of how to best use social media.</p>
        <p><br><em>General Approach</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan your reach</li>
            <li>Measure your reach</li>
            <li>Enhance your reach</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br><em>Plan Your Reach</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set objectives</li>
            <li>Identify the audience
                <ul>
                    <li>What types of people are you trying to target with your media? Parents? Doctors? Young people?</li>
                    <li>Knowing your audience before you begin will make it easier to develop a strategy and market your material to have the greatest effect.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Select the platform
                <ul>
                    <li>See below</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Gather resources and materials - ahead of time!
                <ul>
                    <li>Articles
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easy to stockpile a large number of articles ahead of time to be posted when you may be lacking in material on a given day.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Photos
                        <ul>
                            <li>It’s helpful to take a large number of photos as the beginning of an event (e.g. Lobby Day) but then slowly release them to your followers throughout the day.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Videos
                        <ul>
                            <li>Videos receive nine times the viewership of a regular post!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Put someone or a team in charge
                <ul>
                    <li>Having too many people in charge of social media can make it challenging to streamline your message. Over time, your social media thread will develop a “tone” or “voice” - adding too many people to the mix can make it more challenging to keep this “voice” consistent.</li>
                    <li>If you choose to use many people to update, be sure to have a set plan
                        <ul>
                            <li>How often will each of you post? What types of materials? Do you need to have consensus before posting?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em><strong>What platform should I be using?</strong></em><br><em>Twitter</em><br>What is Twitter?<br>Twitter is a social media website (www.twitter.com) where users can interact with each other in messages limited to 140 characters in duration. A message on Twitter is referred to as a “Tweet”. There is also a private messaging system associated with Twitter where users can send “Direct Messages” to one another.</p>
        <p><br>How does Twitter work?<br><em>Twitter handles</em><br>A Twitter handle is a user’s username. It is represented by the symbol @ (@username). To address a Tweet to someone, simply include their @username at some point in your Tweet.</p>
        <p><br><em>Hashtags</em><br>A hashtag (#) is a method of tagging or identifying Tweets that are related to a specific subject. For example, Tweets relating to a specific issue can all be written with the same #hashtag. This makes it easy to search for Tweets related to a certain topic or event.</p>
        <p><em>Account Settings: Private vs. Public</em><br>There are several things to consider when deciding whether to set the privacy setting of your profile to private or public. When you sign up for your Twitter account, you can set your Tweets to be protected or unprotected. If your Tweets are protected, this means that you must approve each single person who requests to follow you on Twitter - only approved followers can see your Tweets. In terms of using Twitter for advocacy, if you have a protected account and are Tweeting individuals who are not following you, they will not be able to see your Tweets.</p>
        <p><em>Social Media Professionalism</em><br>Find under “CFMS Guide to Social Media and Professionalism (April 2013) at&nbsp;<a href="/media-and-advocacy/positionpapers.html">http://www.cfms.org/media-and-advocacy/positionpapers.html</a></p>
        <p><em>Advantages of using Twitter to contact public figures<br></em>Twitter is a platform for self-promotion and public and political figures invest a lot of time in engaging potential supporters. Promoting their image through a well-maintained profile enables a better relationship with the public and thus more successful campaigns/endeavors. As a result, most public figures are interested in your thoughts and are likely to respond via Twitter.</p>
        <p><em>How can Twitter be used for advocacy?</em><br><em>Targeted use</em><br>Twitter is a cost-free way to share information to a wide variety of people and obtain feedback in real time. It is free to join and can be used as a platform to spread information about specific causes or events of interest to you. Others who are also interested in the same events and causes can connect with you directly using your handle (@username) or can support your cause by using event hashtags.</p>
        <p><em>Hashtags</em><br>As previously outlined, a Hashtag (#) is a way to connect with everyone interested in your event or cause. Simply add the name of the event or cause to the hashtag, and include it in your tweets. Everyone interested in your cause will be able to use this hashtag to see the news. For example, those conducting social media for the CFMS Annual General Meeting in Fall 2014 could use the hashtag #cfms2014. People on Twitter could connect with any news surrounding the conference by searching for the hashtag #cfms2014</p>
        <p><em>Some examples of event-specific hashtags include:<br></em>CFMS Lobby Day in February 2014: #cfmslobby2014<br>OMSA Lobby Day 2013: #omsalobby<br>IFMSA August Meeting 2013: #am2013, #IFMSAReform</p>
        <p><em>Examples of topic-specific hastags include:</em><br>Medical Education: #meded<br>Health: #globalhealth, #cdnhealth, #healthmatters<br>Canadian Poltics: #cdnpoli</p>
        <p><br>Good tweet-bad tweet examples Freedom of speech and expression is a powerful staple on Twitter; however, make sure all tweets treat readers with respect, and keep conversation honest, civil, objective, and polite.</p>
