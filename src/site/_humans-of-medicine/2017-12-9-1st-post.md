"I had a lot of trouble early on in my education reconciling the medical profession with the life I led outside of school. I didn’t know any doctors who I thought were “like me.” Sometimes I still feel that way, but it doesn’t scare me anymore. A close friend once told me “Queer success IS resistance.” And that’s what drives me toward my dreams and to live openly and proudly as a queer person. Each new opportunity I encounter is another chance for a connection with someone who may not see themselves represented in medicine.

I think that’s what so amazing about the Global Health program. So many medical students are at this intersection between medical education and lived experience within marginalized, disenfranchised, and underrepresented populations. Everyone is so energized and passionate, I’ve never felt so inspired."
