*Here's what one of the recipients of the 2017 CFMS–MD Financial Management Leadership Award had to say about the award:*

<div><div><blockquote><p>The generosity from MD Financial Management has made a profound impact on my life, and I am truly grateful to be the recipient of the 2017 CFMS-MD Financial Management Leadership Award. The scholarship went directly toward completion of executive leadership coaching. The executive leadership coaching training involved a core values inventory and one-on-one executive coaching sessions. We worked on several transferable skills: communication (personal analysis questionnaire), emotional intelligence (emotional quotient inventory), resilience, leadership (positive motivation, giving constructive feedback, facilitating conflict), and organizational awareness. I have the utmost confidence that this grant not only prepared me financially, but also provided me with the opportunity to create a solid leadership foundation to contribute significantly to leadership endeavors in Canada and beyond.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div></div>
