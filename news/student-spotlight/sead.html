Mornings started early as students rounded with the residents, then headed to the OR. The group of students came together for lunch, which featured a career discussion lead by a surgeon. In the afternoons, students participated in state-of-the-art workshops at the University of Ottawa Skills and Simulation Centre. Over the 10 days, students experienced an observership, a discussion, and a surgical skills workshop in 9 different surgical specialties. Students honed their foundational skills, such as suturing and instrument handling, and tried their hand at more complex simulated procedures, such as aortic valve replacement and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. With broad and comprehensive exposure to specialties, SEAD aims to help students make more informed career decisions.</p><p>- Brittany Greene and Linden Head</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4></div>
