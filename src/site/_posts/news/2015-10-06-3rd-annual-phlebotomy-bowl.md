It’s time for the start of the 2015-2016 annual Phlebotomy Bowl!

Last year’s challenge was an amazing success – bringing in a total of 751 life-saving blood donations and a total of 105 new blood donors. Congrats to the top schools in 2014-15:

- Most Donations Per Capita: *Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick*
- Most New Donors: *University of British Columbia &ndash; Vancouver*

This year’s challenge runs until February 29, 2016. Our goal is to contribute at least 800 donations, including at least 100 first-time blood donors. We’ll compete for two prizes again – **one for the most donations per capita**, and one for the **most first-time donors**. The winning schools will have their name engraved on their respective plaque which they can proudly display at their school for the year! This way, you get recognition and bragging rights for years!
