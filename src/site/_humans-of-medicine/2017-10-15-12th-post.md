"I'm the first in my family to go into medicine. My parents, both farmers, are my role models and my biggest inspiration. They're two of the hardest working people I know, and have worked extraordinarily hard not only to build our farm, but to give my siblings and I every opportunity they possibly could. Without their constant encouragement and support, I would not be where I am today. No matter where I go or where my career takes me, I'm following their example. And I know they'll be proud of me, no matter what."
