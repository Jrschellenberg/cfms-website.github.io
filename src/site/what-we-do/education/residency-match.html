			<h1 id="page-title">Residency Match</h1>
			<p>Every year, all Canadian medical students who wish to pursue post-graduate medical education in Canada apply for offered residency positions through the match process. The Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMS) administers the match each year through their online application service. For more information on the match process and timeline, please refer to the <a href="https://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/education/cfms-matchbook.html">CFMS Match Book</a> and visit the <a href="https://www.carms.ca/en/">CaRMS website</a>.</p>
			<h1><strong>For Students Unmatched After R-1</strong></h1>
			<p>Results of the first iteration of the match (R-1) are typically made available at noon EST on Match Day, on March 1st. Not all Canadian medical students match in the first iteration. If you did not match in the first iteration, please get in touch with your student affairs office as soon as possible and visit the <a href="https://www.carms.ca/en/">CaRMS website</a> for information on applying for the second iteration of the match.</p>

			<h1><strong>Student Supports and Resources</strong></h1>
			<p>In February 2018, the CFMS launched an unmatched peer mentorship network. If you are a Canadian medical student who has gone unmatched and would like to receive mentorship and peer support from previously unmatched students, please email <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(118,112,101,100,117,99,97,116,105,111,110,64,99,102,109,115,46,111,114,103))">vpeducation@cfms.org</a> to be connected with a mentor. If you are interested in being included in the network as a peer mentor, please email&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(118,112,101,100,117,99,97,116,105,111,110,64,99,102,109,115,46,111,114,103))">vpeducation@cfms.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Match Day can bring complicated emotions and that is normal, regardless of your match status. If you need support, reach out to your loved ones, your student affairs office, or provincial medical association physician support service and know that you are not alone, today or ever.&nbsp;</p>
