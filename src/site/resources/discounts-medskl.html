			<h1><strong>Free Question Bank Access!</strong></h1>
			<hr>
			<img class="pic-right" src="/images/discount-images/medskl-logo.png">
			<p>medskl.com has been designed for medical school students and practicing physicians to learn and review the fundamentals of clinical medicine. medskl.com’s library of content comes from over 200 of the best medical school professors from around the world, and they undergo an editorial peer-review process. Their brief but in-depth video modules cover the spectrum of clinical presentations.</p>
			<p>medskl.com’s mission is to make medical education more effective and accessible whether you are studying for exams or earning CME credits. The core educational modules at medskl.com are always free. However, accessing the practice questions associated with their modules requires a paid subscription.</p>
			<p><strong>CFMS is excited to be collaborating with medskl.com to provide the CFMS member students with free access to their practice question bank!</strong></p>
