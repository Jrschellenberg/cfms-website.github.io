The CFMS Policy Rapid Response Team was formed to rapidly address timely political and health policy issues, and other areas of priority for the CFMS within its advocacy portfolio.

Issues the team would address include reviewing tax reform documents, responding to Pharmacare policy discussions, and drafting federal budget proposal documents.

Experience with the Government Affairs and Advocacy Committee (GAAC) or Global Health Advocate (GHA) role is valued but not required. Interest and dedication to working on health policy are strong assets.
