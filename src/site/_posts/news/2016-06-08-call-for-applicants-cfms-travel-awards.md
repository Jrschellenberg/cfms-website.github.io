#### **Call for Applicants â€“ CFMS Travel Awards**

The CFMS and MD Financial Management have set aside funds for the 2015-2016 academic year to provide financial assistance for CFMS member medical students who wish to attend our Annual General Meeting, held September 23-25, 2016 in Edmonton, Alberta.

This initiative supports non-elected members to attend CFMS meetings with the goals of fostering greater member awareness of CFMS structure and function, promoting increased interest in the CFMS and facilitating increased participation in CFMS activities. The application process is competitive and the CFMS routinely receives a far greater number of applications than the number of funded spots available. Applicants are selected based solely on the merits of their written application as judged by a selection committee.

For full application details please see the attached document [here](/files/meetings/agm-2016/cfms-travel-awards/agm2016 application form_eng.doc) or visit the CFMS website. Applications are due by&nbsp;**July 9<sup>th</sup>2016**.
