###### As a portion of its annual operating budget, the Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS), allocates an amount to its Strategic Initiatives Fund (SIF).  This fund is meant to finance initiatives and projects that arise after the budget for any given year has been approved.  While CFMS’ Student Initiative Grants fund individual initiatives at individual schools, the SIF aims to fund larger scale initiatives or projects across multiple geographies and CFMS portfolios.  The primary objective of this fund is to finance initiatives and projects which are clearly aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives, mission, vision, and values.
