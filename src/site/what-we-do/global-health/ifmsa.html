Since SGM, this issue is now of high priority. A small working group consisting of medical society presidents, CFMS representatives, National Officers, Global Health Liaisons and Government Affairs &amp; Advocacy Committee representatives has been created with aim of submitting a final set of recommendations at the 2017 CFMS AGM. We are asking for feedback from the general CFMS membership via way of the following Google Form: https://goo.gl/forms/gapaPXhruVw14t3A2. Please contact CFMS Vice-President of Government Affairs, Sarah Silverberg, at vpgovtaffairs@cfms.org about any questions or concerns. The feedback form will be available until June 30, 2017.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><u><strong></strong></u></p></div>
