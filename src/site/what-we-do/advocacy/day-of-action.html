		<div id="side-content" class="editable"><h1 id="page-title">Day of Action</h1><p>Each year, medical students from across Canada travel to Ottawa to meet with Parliamentarians and propose a positive health systems change. This event includes extensive advocacy training in advance of the meetings. It is an excellent opportunity for medical students interested in national health care advocacy.</p><p>Representatives from each of our member institutions are selected at the local level. Please contact your respective Government Affairs and Advocacy Committee representative if you are interested in being a part of Lobby Day.</p><p>The Day of Action would not be possible without our dedicated team of medical students on the <strong><a href="/what-we-do/advocacy/research-committee.html">Day of Action Research Committee</a></strong> that puts together the ask document, backgrounder document, and coordinates the consultation process.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2018 Day of Action: Indigenous Mental Wellness</strong></h3><p>Mental wellness is a critical issue for Indigenous communities in Canada. The prevalence of mental illness and suicide is significantly higher amongst Indigenous people than the general Canadian population. Two years after the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report in 2015, the issue remains largely unresolved with access to high-quality, culturally-competent mental health care continuing to be limited amongst Indigenous communities.</p><p>As an organization, the CFMS acknowledges that critical healthcare needs amongst Indigenous populations remain largely unmet, especially within the realm of mental health and wellness. As such, we believe as future healthcare professionals, we have an obligation to advocate for the health and wellness of Indigenous peoples.</p><h3><strong>2017 Day of Action: The National Opioid Crisis</strong></h3><p>Canadians are the second highest per capita consumers of prescription opioid drugs in the world, with physicians writing 53 prescriptions for opioid drugs for every 100 people in the country. The widespread availability of opioids has led to increasing rates of opioid dependency and a demand for illicit opioids nationwide, issues which have culminated in calls for the federal government to declare a public health emergency, as was done in April last year at the provincial level in British Columbia.<em></em></p><p>On February 13<sup>th</sup>, 2017, over 60 medical students from across Canada met with Members of Parliament and Senators in Ottawa to discuss action on the opioid crisis, focusing on upstream factors such as chronic pain and access to mental health services. We have formed a partnership with Health Canada to continue work on this topic and have included commitments for the updated Joint Statements of Action. Our efforts were featured on CBC in Calgary, and further efforts by our UBC team with their provincial government garnered significant local coverage in British Columbia. We are glad to see Canada&rsquo;s policy makers are taking this issue seriously and are hopeful of meaningful change.</p><h3><strong>Past Day of Action Resources</strong></h3><p>2017 CFMS Day of Action Backgrounder Document: <a href="/Advocacy/CFMS National Lobby Day 2017 Backgrounder.pdf">Download</a><br />2017 CFMS Day of Action Handout Document: <a href="/Advocacy/CFMS National Lobby Day 2017 Handout.docx">Download</a></p><p>2016 CFMS Day of Action Backgrounder Document: <a href="/Advocacy/CFMS National Lobby Day 2016 Backgrounder.pdf">Download</a><br />2016 CFMS Day of Action Handout Document: <a href="/Advocacy/CFMS National Lobby Day 2016 Handout.docx">Download</a></p><blockquote><h4><strong>For More Information:</strong></h4><p><strong>Yipeng Ge</strong>, Vice President Government Affairs<br />Canadian Federation of Medical Students<br /><a href="mailto:vpgovtaffairs@cfms.org">vpgovtaffairs@cfms.org</a></p><p><strong>Willow Thickson</strong>, National Officer of Indigenous Health<br />Canadian Federation of Medical Students<br /><a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(110,111,105,104,64,99,102,109,115,46,111,114,103))">noih@cfms.org</a></p><p><b>Christina Schweitzer</b>, Vice President Communications<br />Canadian Federation of Medical Students<br /><a href="mailto:vpcommunications@cfms.org">vpcommunications@cfms.org</a></p></blockquote></div>
