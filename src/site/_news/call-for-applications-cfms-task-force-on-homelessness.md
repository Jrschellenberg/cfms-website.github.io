Applications are now open for the CFMS Task Force on Homelessness. This is a great opportunity to contribute to a nationwide medical student effort to improve healthcare access and delivery in homeless populations.

The CFMS Task Force on Homelessness was established by a [resolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hdyUaSQeOFCVKMp2TpARFWwFX621ZdagidoPlM5hIoI/edit?usp=sharing) passed at the 2018 Spring General Meeting, and is now recruiting members.

The purpose of this group is to:

1. Extensively research the current state of healthcare access, delivery, and resources in homeless populations across Canada
2. Develop an advocacy framework that combines research evidence with the experiences of grassroots advocacy efforts and organisations across the country
3. Propose a strategy for medical students to operationalize this framework within their individual communities/curricula

**Applications are due Monday, June 4th, 2018 at 5 PM EST.**
