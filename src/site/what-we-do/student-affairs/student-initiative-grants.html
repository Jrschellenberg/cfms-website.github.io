            Cycle</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>CFMS Student Initiative Grants were established in 2007 to provide support and funding to medical student
            initiatives. The fund was established in response to the increasing number of medical student run
            initiatives and the need for official and financial support from our national student organization. <a

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Please see the <a target="_blank" href="/uploads/SIG Program Guidelines-1.pdf">guidelines here</a> for more
            information about the grants and how your application will be scored.</p>
        <p>Many successful projects have benefitted from direct CFMS funding including charitable, educational and
            social events all organized by medical students. The goal is to assist students in realizing events or
            initiatives that promote interactions between CFMS students and member schools.</p>
        <blockquote><p><strong>Projects will be considered based on the following guidelines and criteria:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancement of the educational expereince of Canadian Medical Students</li>
                <li>Enhancement of the Canadian Healthcare System</li>
                <li>Enhancement of the local or national community</li>
                <li>Potential for sustainability</li>
                <li>Practicality and level of planning in the proposal, including transparency and an Itemized budget
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bonus point</strong> awarded for proposals for projects that are deemed to have a
                    significant potential for impact to the CFMS Member Students
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text-red">** It is important to note that these criteria are general and not all-inclusive. If your
            project does not fill all of these criteria there is still great potential for funding **</p>
        <blockquote><p><strong>Project guidelines:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Projects will NOT be considered if they have been recipients of CFMS Student Initiative Grants in
                    the last 5 years
                </li>
                <li>Projects will receive a maximum funding amount of $3000. Please do not increase your budget to ask
                    for this maximum, as we wish to fund as many projects as possible, however for projects with a
                    larger budget, please take note of this limit and look for funding from other sources such that you
                    are able to complete your project with only partial funding from the CFMS.
                </li>
                <li>The Student Initiative Grants are NOT meant to fund academic research or travel funding to
                    conferences for individual medical students
                </li>
            </ul>
