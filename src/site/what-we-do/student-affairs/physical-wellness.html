            This is also great as the weather’s getting warmer, and this would allow you to get outdoors and get a good dose of vitamin D!

            <i>McGill Spin Bike Gardens: </i>Spin Bike Gardens (SBG) is aimed to improve wellbeing, and mental health at McGill by helping to integrate exercise in the daily lives of students, and by providing means to exercise within study and learning spaces. These spots are located throughout campus near study spaces, and notable near the Osler Library, the medical school library. These spaces offer the opportunity to exercise by taking a short spin break if you are in need of a study break or if you have some time in between classes. These spaces are equipped with silent spin breaks and are surrounded by lots of plants and meditative art making this a very calm and soothing environment shown to be beneficial for mental health. 
            <img src="/images/lwi-images/physical-wellness/week-1/spin-bike-gardens.png">

            <i>Exercise is Medicine:</i> McGill's Exercise Is Medicine Club (EIMC) aims to empower students to use exercise to improve their wellbeing and mental health. It organizes several different workouts and training sessions for students throughout the year, like circuit training, boot camps and crossfit sessions.

            <br><br>
            <i>Free summer gym memberships for medical students:</i> Though this isn’t exactly a student initiative, it is important for McGill medical students to know that they get the benefit of a free summer gym membership at the McGill Gym. This encourages physical activity for our medical students, and hopefully helps instill good habits that will remain after summer ends. 
        </p>

        <!--Memorial University -->
        <h3 id="memorial"><strong>Memorial University</strong></h3>

These activities help students destress and also facilitate interactions between the different MD classes so students can get to know each other better and broaden their social network. For example, during the cold winter months, we facilitated groups to skate on the Rideau Canal, play Archery Tag, and go rock climbing/bouldering. We also collaborate with the VP Athletics representative of our student council to host larger events, such as a sports day, where students can form teams and compete in a sports competition.

A variety of teachers participate and organize sequences that incorporate multiple styles of yoga including hatha, ashtanga and yin. Yoga blocks and mats are provided for an enhanced practice and extra challenge. Semi-annual workshops are held to promote stress management and offer additional postures to practitioners.
            <br><br>
            <i>Exercise is Medicine </i>on Campus at UBC (EIMC UBC) is an initiative aimed at encouraging exercise in clinical practice and fostering early inter-professional relationships. UBC medical students across all four sites will have the opportunity to collaborate with medical faculty, health care professionals, and students in other fields (eg. physiotherapy, nursing, kinesiology) to create physical activity opportunities and events promoting exercise as a means to preventing and managing chronic disease.
            <br>
            Health care is a team-based endeavour and inter-professional collaboration is essential to optimize patient outcomes. This club additionally aims to encourage medical students to begin building inter-professional relationships. EIMC UBC will equip students with the education (eg.medical evidence supporting the benefits of exercise) and tools to prescribe physical activity both in the short term (eg.through community events) and the long term (eg.through future clinical practice). We want to collaborate with Doctors of BC to promote existing events (eg.Walk with your Doc) as well as host new events for students (eg.a motivational interviewing workshop accessible by all sites illustrating how motivational interviewing can be used to elicit positive behaviour change). EIMC UBC strives to provide multiple exposures and experiences for students to learn how to incorporate and emphasize the importance of physical activity in the future of medical care.
            <br><br>
            <i>Med Climbing Club </i>is an interest group seeking to connect fellow climbers across all years of medicine, as well as host events for those looking to learn more about the sport.

            <br><br>
            <i>Ultimate </i>is a self-officiated non-contact sport. Through this fun sport, students will not only find themselves bonding with one another, but also they will be practicing crucial qualities of a competent doctor, such as integrity, leadership, teamwork, and communication. In order to promote such a community, UBC Med Ultimate holds  skills development clinics so students new to the sport can learn new skills and experience the sport.

The focus is on 3 aspects: Education for students on importance of exercise prescription in place of commonly prescribed medications, patient encounters (have patients with heart disease/diabetes/stroke etc. come in and discuss how exercise has impacted their health and rehabilitation), and simulated patient experiences where students practice counselling patients on the benefits of physical activity. We also put on an Exercise Prescription Workshop usually in the Winter semester. The interest group also organizes bi-annual gym crawls (visiting 4-5 different gyms/yoga studios/crossfit gyms etc. around the city). 
            <br><br>

        <p>
            When I was moving from one apartment to another I decided to change a mattress and while researching on the topic I came across a really interesting website on sleep that had some information on napping. I wish I found it earlier and have used the tips and insights they provide on sleep. I hope this will be useful to my fellow colleagues especially for clerkship when sleep becomes a precious resource.

            There is a ton of blogs and resources that exist on workouts and some are more advanced or time consuming than others. I came across this article that has a 10 minute morning routine in bed that I can use before a day in a clinic. Another useful video is on  a quick stretch routine at the desk for the days when you study for exams or spend a lot of time typing up consult notes.

            Anything is better than nothing! If you don’t have time/motivation/money to go to the gym, that’s okay, we all have our obstacles. If you take 30-seconds to do 5 push-ups or jumping jacks, that’s still better than doing nothing, because if you do even a little something when you originally wanted to do nothing, that’s a win for you :)! Do your best to set realistic physical activity goals for yourself that you know you can achieve. It is much better for your self-esteem and motivation to get 3 days of exercise a week 95% of the time than to try and get 4 days of exercise a week and be disappointed when reaching it only 70% of the time.

            Physical activity energizes you in a way that nothing else does. When I get into a rut with exercising, I’m more tired, less energetic, I need more coffee to get through the day, and I stress-eat unhealthy food. When I focus that energy into something productive, like going for a jog, a walk, a hike, or doing some yoga, I feel more relaxed, energized, and able to focus on studying or other work. Every time I get back into my routine, I marvel at how unwell I felt when I wasn’t exercising, and I didn’t even realize it. Exercise truly is the best medicine.
