		  <p>Each year the CFMS and MD Financial Management set aside funds to provide financial assistance for CFMS member medical students who wish to attend our Annual Meetings</p>
		  <p>This initiative supports non-elected members to attend CFMS meetings with the goals of fostering greater member awareness of CFMS structure and function, promoting increased interest in the CFMS and facilitating increased participation in CFMS activities. The application process is competitive and the CFMS routinely receives a far greater number of applications than the number of funded spots available. Applicants are selected based solely on the merits of their written application as judged by a selection committee.</p>
		  <p><strong>New: </strong>Travel Awards will be distributed by region to ensure a more equal student representation across the country. There are 8 awards for each meeting, 2 for the Western region, 1 for the Atlantic region, 3 for the Quebec + Ontario regions, and 2 Wildcard awards.</p>
		  <p>Travel awards will open 1 month prior to each event. Please check back for details.</p>
