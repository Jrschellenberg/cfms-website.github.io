[MD Financial Management Inc. (MD)](https://mdm.ca/), a Canadian Medical Association (CMA)-owned financial management organization, and the [Canadian Federation of Medical Students](http://www.cfms.org/) (CFMS) today announced a collaborative partnership that makes MD the exclusive financial services’ partner of the CFMS.
 
“We are pleased to be working together with the CFMS to provide even better support to [Canadian medical students](https://mdm.ca/career-stages/student/index.asp)”, said Mike Gassewitz, MD’s Executive Vice-President of Member Solutions. “As a CMA company, we are dedicated to meeting physicians’ financial needs throughout their lives and careers, and this starts in medical school. This partnership will enable us to help more medical students take the worry out of their finances and start their careers on the best possible financial footing, leaving them able to focus on their studies.”
 
MD’s sole focus is to help Canadian physicians and their families achieve greater financial security and peace of mind. That focussed commitment starts with supporting medical students and helping ensure they succeed as they begin their careers, whether it is providing advice on debt management, paying for medical school or preparing for residency and practice.
 
“We’re very excited to be entering into this partnership with MD,” said Bryce Durafourt, CFMS President. “Students will benefit from an improved level of support from CFMS and MD through a wide range of information, events and services that have been specifically created with them in mind.”
 
Medical students can benefit from MD's specialized network of advisors who are dedicated to addressing the financial needs and goals of medical students, including advice about how to finance medical education while minimizing debt.
