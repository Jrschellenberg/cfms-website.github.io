			<p>We are very excited to announce the launch of the CFMS Longitudinal Wellness Initiative! This new exciting initiative strives to highlight supportive strategies and resources to promote different components of wellness. Additionally we will be highlighting medical students across Canada and their wellness journeys. We hope to  inspire and encourage connectedness, support, and discussion around wellness in medicine.<br><br>We will be focusing on one aspect of wellness over a two month period throughout the year, beginning with Nutrition in March and April and moving to Mental wellness in May and June of 2018. After the summer break we will start the school year with Physical wellness in September and October, then move to Social/Relationships wellness in November-December. Stay tuned for our posts on the CFMS website, our social media and CFMS Communique featuring student Spotlights and wellness resources. Stay tuned for opportunities to get involved!</p>

						<li class="exec-desc"><span>Last year, I stumbled into an involvement in wellness programming when I took the position of VP for the MUN Med Soc. I quickly realized that the wellness portfolio of my role was by far the most rewarding, and the most effective way to positively impact medical students. This year, I wanted to step up my involvement with wellness programming to a national level, and have been lucky enough to get the opportunity to work closely with the CFMS Wellness team. I most look forward to rolling out the Longitudinal Wellness Initiative in order to create more consistent, long-term wellness support and resources available for medical students.</span></li>

						<li class="exec-desc"><span>I became interested in the  Longitudinal Wellness Initiative because wellness is something that should be at the forefront of our minds during the entire year. Students constantly lose track of their own wellness while working to be able to help the wellness of others. Some people have never encountered the amount of stress and time constraints such as in medicine before and are not as equipped to work through it. An initiative which brings these things into focus throughout the year I feel is extremely important!</span></li>

						<li class="exec-desc"><span>Wellness has become something that I am very passionate about, not only personally, but also because it is an area that is often overlooked in medicine, yet plays such a vital role in maintaining our health. As the uOttawa VP Community Health, Wellness Co-chair and member of the CFMS wellness committee, the Longitudinal Wellness Initiative posed a very exciting opportunity to be involved in what I believe is a needed change in promoting wellness as a longitudinal lifelong goal. I am so excited to be part of launching the LWI which I truly feel will help raise awareness and emphasize the importance of maintaining all aspects of wellness all year long.</span></li>

To me, wellness is about healthy relationships with our loved ones, our communities, our food, our minds and our bodies. It can be difficult to achieve, especially with the stress that comes with medical school on top of our daily lives, and we all have moments when we aren’t taking care of ourselves to the best of our abilities. I joined the CFMS-LWI to help make personal wellness feel like a natural part of our everyday lives, rather than a chore. I’m excited to be a part of an initiative that promotes student wellbeing all year long!</span></li>

I look forward to working with a team that’s dedicated to bettering the health of all students alike.</span></li>
