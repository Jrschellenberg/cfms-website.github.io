You are invited to be a part of Choosing Wisely Canada, a grassroots, physician-led campaign to engage physicians and patients in conversations about unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures.

In partnership with the Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS), we would like your input on developing a list of &ldquo;Five Things Medical Students Should Question&rdquo; to reduce unnecessary care. This will be the first Choosing Wisely list of its kind, targeted at medical students.

This anonymous and voluntary survey will take under 5 minutes, and your input will be a part of changing the culture of medical education to reduce unnecessary care. Not to mention, upon completion of the survey, you have the opportunity to enter your name in a draw to win an APPLE WATCH and one of ten TIM HORTON&rsquo;S gift cards!
