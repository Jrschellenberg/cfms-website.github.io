        <br />
        <p class="editable">CFMS Student Initiative Grants were established in 2007 to provide support and funding to medical student initiatives.
            The fund was established in response to the increasing number of medical student run initiatives and the need for official
            and financial support from our national student organization.

            the grants and how your application will be scored.
        </p>
        
         <p class="editable">Many successful projects have benefitted from direct CFMS funding including charitable, educational and social events all
           organized by medical students. The goal is to assist students in realizing events or initiatives that promote interactions between
           CFMS students and member schools.</p>

                    for this maximum, as we wish to fund as many projects as possible, however for projects with a
                    larger budget, please take note of this limit and look for funding from other sources such that
                    you are able to complete your project with only partial funding from the CFMS.</li>
