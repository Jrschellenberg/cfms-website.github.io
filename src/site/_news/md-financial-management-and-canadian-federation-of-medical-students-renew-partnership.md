**MD will continue to be the exclusive financial services partner for the CFMS**

[MD Financial Management Inc.](https://mdm.ca/) (MD) and the [Canadian Federation of Medical Students](http://www.cfms.org/) (CFMS) recently [confirmed the renewal of their collaborative partnership](https://mdm.ca/about-md/news-and-events/md-news/md-financial-management-and-canadian-federation-of-medical-students-renew-partnership) that makes MD the exclusive financial services partner of the CFMS. MD is a financial management organization, owned by the Canadian Medical Association.

“We are very pleased to renew our partnership with the CFMS,” said Allison Seymour, MD’s Executive Vice President of Member and Community Engagement. “MD has close to 50 years’ experience working with medical students. This, plus our close collaboration with the CFMS, is enabling us to develop even more opportunities and services tailored to Canada’s future healthcare leaders.”

“Our relationship with CFMS is a valuable component of our commitment to supporting medical students,” said Michelle Masson, MD’s Executive Vice President of the Early Career Segment. “We have a dedicated team of MD Advisors working with medical students to support their decision-making and planning for all aspects of life, including financial, so that the students can concentrate on the demands of medical school.”

MD helps medical students and physicians develop a plan for prosperity so they can live their best possible life, today and tomorrow. With decades of experience supporting physicians at every step of their careers—from medical school through retirement and beyond—MD anticipates physicians’ needs, understands their challenges and appreciates their expectations. MD’s support starts with becoming a trusted partner to medical students and helping them succeed now and in the future, whether it is by providing advice on debt management and paying for medical school or helping them to prepare for residency and practice.

“The CFMS is pleased to continue the good work we’ve started with MD through this partnership,” said Henry Annan, President of the CFMS. “This includes access to specialized MD content that looks to improve financial literacy among our members, the [CFMS–MD Financial Management Leadership Awards](https://mdm.ca/about-md/news-and-events/md-news/md-financial-management-announces-the-recipients-of-the-2016-2017-cfms-md-financial-management-leadership-awards) and the MD Travel Awards.”

The MD Travel Awards provide an opportunity for selected students to attend CFMS events, including the national Day of Action and the spring and annual general meetings. These students would otherwise have to pay out of pocket to attend these events, which offer important opportunities for them to bring their interests to the forefront and to advocate for positive changes to the Canadian healthcare system.

All Canadian medical students can benefit from MD’s specialized network of advisors. These professionals are dedicated to addressing the financial needs and goals of medical students, including providing advice about how to finance medical education while minimizing debt.
