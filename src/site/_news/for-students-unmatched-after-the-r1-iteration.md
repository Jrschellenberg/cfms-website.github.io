# **For Students Unmatched After the R-1 Match**

Results of the first iteration of the R-1 Match are officially made available at&nbsp;***12:00 (noon) EST on Tuesday, February 26th***.

The CFMS congratulates all Canadian medical students who completed the first iteration R-1 match. You worked hard and the CFMS is proud to have represented you during your medical school journey. Good luck to all taking their next steps toward residency!&nbsp;

If you did not match and are a CFMS member, we have listed some steps for you to consider. Your Student Affairs and Undergraduate Medical Education offices have been made aware of these supports as well:

**1) CFMS Unmatched Peer Mentorship Network:**&nbsp;If you wish to be put in touch with a previously unmatched student mentor you may contact the CFMS Director of Education at&nbsp;[education@cfms.org](mailto:education@cfms.org). &nbsp;Your confidentiality will be respected.

**2) CFMS Matchbook:&nbsp;**the 2018 Matchbook is accessible to CFMS members via our website and can be accessed[&nbsp;here](https://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/education/cfms-matchbook.html). &nbsp;It is updated with advice for the unmatched student. More specifically, Section 4.3 “The Unmatched Scenario” is a detailed toolkit put together by the CFMS Unmatched CMG Task Force which is comprised of previously unmatched students.

**3) Second Round Application Reimbursement:**&nbsp;The CFMS is able to offer all unmatched students $150 to support applying to the second round of the R1 match. The reimbursement form you may use is available&nbsp;[here](https://www.cfms.org/2nd%20Iteration%20Reimbursement%20Claim%20Form%20%20(1).docx).

**4) Wellness Supports:&nbsp;**We encourage all learners to be in close contact with their Student Affairs offices for comprehensive support during this process. You can find contact information for the different provincial health programs (PHPs)[&nbsp;here](https://www.cma.ca/provincial-physician-health-programs). Our website also has PDF documents for all 15 of our member medical schools with information regarding specific wellness related supports that are always available. They can be accessed[&nbsp;here](https://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/student-affairs/wellness.html).

If you are not matched after the first iteration, you are not alone. There are many resources to help you as you continue along your journey to being a successful physician.

Please feel free to get in touch with us at any time by emailing the CFMS Director of Education, Maylynn Ding, at&nbsp;[education@cfms.org](mailto:education@cfms.org). Your confidentiality will be respected.

# **Student Supports and Resources**

In February 2018, the CFMS launched an unmatched peer mentorship network. If you are a CFMS member who is unmatched and would like to receive mentorship and peer support from previously unmatched students, please email&nbsp;[education@cfms.org](mailto:education@cfms.org)&nbsp;to be connected with a mentor. If you are interested in being included in the network as a peer mentor, please email&nbsp;[education@cfms.org](mailto:education@cfms.org).&nbsp;

Match Day can bring complicated emotions and that is normal, regardless of your match status. If you need support, reach out to your loved ones, your student affairs office, or provincial medical association physician support service and know that you are not alone, today or ever.&nbsp;
