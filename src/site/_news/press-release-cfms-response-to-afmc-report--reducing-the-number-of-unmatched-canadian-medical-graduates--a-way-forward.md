OTTAWA, FEBRUARY 21, 2018 – The Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) applauds the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC) Board of Directors’ recent approval of a comprehensive report on unmatched Canadian Medical Graduates (uCMGs).

&nbsp;

The AFMC Report – *[Reducing the Number of Unmatched Canadian Medical Graduates: A Way Forward](https://afmc.ca/publications/reducing-number-unmatched-canadian-medical-graduates)* – outlines the complexity of the current Canadian residency matching environment. Should the status quo remain, the AFMC predicts that the number of current year uCMGs will exceed 140 in 2021, up from 68 in 2017. The AFMC Resident Matching Committee (ARMC) has identified the decreasing ratio of current year CMGs to postgraduate entry positions, from 1:1.1 in 2012 to 1:1.026 in 2017, as a significant factor in the rising number of uCMGs. In-depth data analyses revealed that over two-thirds of uCMGs are applicants who could have matched to residency programs had there been enough positions available in the programs to which they applied.

&nbsp;

The work of the AFMC dovetails with the strong advocacy efforts by the CFMS on the transition to residency since 2015. In September 2017, the CFMS general assembly passed a landmark paper entitled *[Support for Unmatched Canadian Medical Students](https://www.cfms.org/files/position-papers/agm_2017_support_unmatched.pdf)*. This document, in addition to calling for a current year CMGs to postgraduate entry position ratio of 1:1.2, underlines the need for faculties to do more in supporting their unmatched graduates.

We are therefore pleased with the faculties’ commitment to ensuring that policies, structures and procedures are in place to support uCMGs. The CFMS also supports the AFMC’s call to provincial funders to increase the number of residency positions for CMGs, aligned with population health needs. Finally, the CFMS looks forward to continuing to work with the AFMC, other medical education organizations and the health jurisdictions to develop robust pan-Canadian planning frameworks that ensure that the integrity and fairness of the national match is preserved.

&nbsp;

We look forward to continuing&nbsp; to collaborate with the AFMC&nbsp; and other stakeholders as we work to ensure that all Canadian medical students have a fair and equal chance to match to a Canadian residency program.

By working together to ensure that the ratios of current year CMG to postgraduate entry positions are optimized and that our unmatched students are well supported while unmatched, I am confident that we will soon a curb to this national crisis. We urge provincial funders to join us in working together towards ensuring there are adequate residency positions for Canadian medical graduates.”

I am thrilled to see that the advocacy work of the CFMS and unmatched students across Canada has helped to create a ‘way forward.’ This is only the beginning and I look forward to building off this document, and continuing to advocate for increased supports for unmatched CMGs.”
