The CFMS and Ontario Medical Students Association (OMSA) are excited to announce an update to the [Student-Run Clinic (SRC) toolkit](http://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/education/src-toolkit.html). In collaboration with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO), we have added a section on regulatory and legal frameworks for SRC's.&nbsp;

The joint CFMS/OMSA Toolkit development team is grateful to the CPSO for their input, direction, and advice in this matter. We are confident that this addendum will help students answer questions regarding the legal and regulatory status of SRCs as they set up and run SRCs at their own schools. You can find the latest iteration of the SRC Toolkit [here](http://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/education/src-toolkit.html).
