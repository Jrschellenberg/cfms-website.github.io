"I worry that as I continue through my medical career, I may become acclimatized to various sub-optimal aspects of patient care and accept them as 'the way we've always done things.' I'm realizing more and more the importance of becoming involved in advocacy and quality improvement as I continue in my studies and future practice. However, making change in a system with a limited budget and one that is entrenched in tradition will require both patients and healthcare practitioners to speak up about sub-optimal aspects of care."
