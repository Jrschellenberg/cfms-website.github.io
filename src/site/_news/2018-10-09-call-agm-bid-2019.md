**The CFMS is now accepting applications from member schools to host the 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM)!**

Each year a CFMS member school hosts the CFMS AGM in or near the city of their medical school or its distributed campuses. This provides an excellent opportunity to increase the profile of your medical school/medical student society, increase CFMS awareness to students at your home school, and a chance to host friends and colleagues from the CFMS in your hometown.

**The CFMS Board will review applications received by December 3rd, 2018 11:59 PM EST, with the winning school announced on December 10th.**

Please see the attached Proposal Request document which outlines all items needed in a school’s bid. The scoring matrix is also included to help facilitate your application process.

Any requests, questions or concerns can be directed to the chair of the AGM Bid Committee & Quebec Regional Director, Adel Arezki ([quebec@cfms.org](mailto:quebec@cfms.org)).
