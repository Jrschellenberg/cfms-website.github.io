								<ol>

									<li>Outline the ways in which you support others to engage with their communities and achieve their goals (personal, professional, wellness, etc).</li>

								<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: Only official Letters of Good Standing obtained through your faculty will be accepted. Please be aware that these are different than confirmations of enrollment, as they indicate your current status as a practicing medical student within the faculty. Anything other than a formal Letter of Good Standing will not be accepted and will result in your application being incomplete.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Two Reference Letters
								<p>Please provide two reference letters (<strong>maximum between 400-600 words each</strong>; please communicate this limit to your references) from individuals who are familiar with your leadership accomplishments.</p>

Referees may be contacted by the CFMS to verify activities and leadership contributions of the applicant.</p>
								<p>Please note that reference letters must be uploaded manually into your online application. This can be done by the referees themselves, with you assistance in accessing the application, or by yourself. <strong>If you are uploading reference letters on behalf of your referees, please remain mindful of your professionalism and keep all letters confidential and unedited.</strong></p>

					<h1><strong>Eligibility</strong></h1>
					<hr>
					<p>Any medical student attending a CFMS member school is eligible. However, <strong>students who hold or have previously held a position on the CFMS Executive Committee or as a CFMS Officer during their medical studies are ineligible to apply.</strong></p>
					<blockquote>
						<h3><strong>Eligibility Inquiries</strong></h3>
						<p>CFMS membership is based on your membership within your respective medical student societies. Therefore, for specific inquiries regarding your status as a CFMS member, and therefore your eligibility for the award competition (i.e. student's on leave, MD/PhD students, etc.), please consult with your medical student society and their bylaws to determine your status as a member.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<h1><strong>Awards Selection</strong></h1>
					<hr>
					<p>The Selection Committee consists of CFMS Alumni who were active medical student leaders and are now residents and staff physicians. Applications are reviewed using a multi-evaluator scoring process in an effort to provide fair and reasonable consideration of all applicants.</p>
					<p><strong>The CFMS considers professionalism to be an extremely important value for all medical students to uphold. As a result, any applicant who is considered to have falsified information on their application will be reviewed and may be disqualified from award consideration.</strong></p>
					<h1><strong>Award Distribution</strong></h1>
					<hr>
					<p>Award winners will be invited to receive their award in person during the CFMS Spring General Meeting in Niagara Falls on April 12-13th 2019. For winners who cannot attend the meeting, the CFMS Representative from your school will accept the award on your behalf. Cash prizes will be distributed in person at SGM or by mail following SGM.</p>
					<p>A short bio outlining the winners’ accomplishments will be posted at <a href="http://www.cfms.org">www.cfms.org</a> and may be used by MD Financial Management for the promotion of award winners.</p>
