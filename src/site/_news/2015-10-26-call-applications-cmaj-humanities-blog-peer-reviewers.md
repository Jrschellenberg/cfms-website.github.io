These are volunteer positions presenting the opportunity to learn about the editing process.

Submissions sought have included poetry, essays, critiques, reviews (films, novels, theatre, etc.), interviews (profiles or conversations), reflective pieces, event reports, graphic medicine and visual art pertaining to the medical humanities. Since its launch, a diverse selection of quality student work has been published on the *CMAJ* blog.
