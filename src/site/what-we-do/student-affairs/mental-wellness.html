                <i>Our Stories -</i> An evening dedicated to having a judgment free open-mic night where we invite students to come and listen to the stories of their peers or tell their own! We aim to de-stigmatize mental illness and get uOttawa medical students talking about their experiences. The event is closed to the public and only medical students are allowed to attend to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Students can choose to submit their stories in advance to read themselves at the event or submit anonymous stories that can be read by their peers. We hold a pre-reading for our speakers the evening before at our wellness committee co-chair’s house to ensure that all speakers have had a chance to run through their story and share it with others prior to presenting in front of a large audience. We hold this event off campus to help create a more private atmosphere and avoid direct affiliation with the faculty to help students feel more open about sharing. On the night of the event, at intermission, we allow students to sign up to share on the day of. This is very well attended event and has really helped to create a more welcoming environment at uOttawa.

                <i>De-stressing Room -</i> Prior to the first year’s first exam in the fall, the Student Wellness Committee hosted a “De-stressing Room” held in one of our small group session rooms. We had healthy snacks, games, colouring books and decorations to create a more welcoming environment. We also had members of our Peer Tutoring team and wellness committee sit in the room so that students could come to talk to upper years in hopes of allowing them to escape the often stressful studying stress bubble of their own class in the library. The aim of this room was to encourage students to remember to take a break and look after themselves while studying. We also had a brainstorming wall on the whiteboard of “What makes you well?” where students could come in and write/draw things on the board that help them to destress while in the exam season. 
            </p>

            <p><i>Wide Open -</i> This a new event this year that the Student Wellness Committee has organized this year. The event is focussed on creating small group sessions to promote discussions about mental health and coping strategies throughout medical school. Following Our Stories, we wanted to continue the discussion about mental health and some of the struggles that all of us experience to help break the stigma of mental health wide open.</p>

            <p><i>Mindfulness -</i> As part of our curriculum throughout medical school, our faculty provides us with mandatory mindfulness sessions where we learn some of the basic skills of mindfulness. They also provide weekly mindfulness drop in sessions every week. </p>

            <p><i>Mindfulness Workshops -</i> Our student wellness consult offers weekly sessions in mindfulness throughout the year. This short mindfulness practice occurs for 20 minutes before classes on Thursday morning. As part of CFMS Wellness Month, our wellness consultant also offers an hour-long presentation on the benefits of mindfulness and how to incorporate it into the lives of busy medical students.</p>

            <p><i>Mental Health Pop-Ups -</i> The wellness committee and psychiatry interest group have come together to set up a small coloring station with coffee, tea and treats. This allows students to drop by and take a mental health break from their busy school day.</p>

            <p>I really like this free, self-paced online course on the science of happiness. I find a lot of their videos and reading materials very motivating and easy to follow. They talk a lot about mindfulness, cooperation, empathy and compassion, as well as forgiveness and what happiness actually means. It is focused on the positive side of things and I find the information presented there very useful for my personal life and even clinical interactions with patients. </p>
